The
following
editorial
appeared
in
Monday
's
Washington
Post
:
The
sudden
,
brutal
death
of
Diana
,
princess
of
Wales
,
at
the
young
age
of
36
,
preempted
and
quickly
engulfed
all
other
news
and
all
other
subjects
Saturday
night
.

This
was
true
not
just
in
Britain
and
the
rest
of
Western
Europe
and
the
United
States
,
but
all
around
the
world
.

There
was
much
more
to
this
response
,
we
think
,
which
included
a
torrent
of
expressions
of
grief
and
offerings
of
flowers
and
other
tokens
of
condolence
,
than
the
usual
,
age-old
human
fascination
with
horrible
accidents
and
unexpected
reversals
of
fortune
,
especially
as
they
befall
the
powerful
and
exalted
.

And
the
predictable
media
extravagance
and
exploitation
did
n't
explain
it
all
either
.

The
young
woman
who
died
in
a
Paris
hospital
at
the
end
of
the
summer
of
1997
,
had
been
,
from
the
day
almost
two
decades
ago
when
she
entered
the
public
's
consciousness
as
the
wife-to-be
of
the
heir
to
the
British
throne
,
the
central
figure
in
a
gripping
and
continuously
unfolding
drama
.

It
was
part
``
fairy
tale
''
and
romance
,
as
no
one
ever
tired
of
saying
,
but
in
larger
part
we
think
,
contemporary
morality
play
,
as
well
and
nothing
if
not
searingly
up
to
date
.

Diana
,
as
one
commentator
observed
Saturday
night
,
grew
into
an
identifiable
human
being
in
the
course
of
her
miserable
marriage
and
its
aftermath
,
as
distinct
from
the
innocent
,
happy
,
almost
fictional
abstraction
she
had
seemed
to
be
at
the
beginning
of
the
public
's
fascination
with
her
.

Behind
all
the
luxury
and
glamour
and
high-style
,
she
seemed
to
be
dealing
in
the
1997
way
with
the
familiar
personal
issues
that
so
many
others
face
.

She
was
breathtakingly
unconventional
by
traditional
standards
of
propriety
and
role-modelship
.

At
the
same
time
she
was
deeply
engaged
in
good
works
and
proved
it
by
taking
real
personal
risks
in
the
pursuit
of
her
different
causes
.

She
was
insistent
that
her
children
gain
an
unroyal
appreciation
of
something
approximating
normal
life
.

And
she
was
famous
for
her
ability
to
connect
naturally
and
empathetically
with
others
who
lived
far
outside
the
beautiful-people
universe
she
inhabited
.

It
was
her
insistence
on
trying
to
add
this
dimension
to
her
royal
life
and
succeeding
in
doing
so
that
distinguished
her
,
we
think
,
and
won
her
a
wide
following
.

The
conduct
of
the
``
paparazzi
''
was
said
to
have
been
particularly
reckless
on
Saturday
night
,
and
the
alleged
response
of
one
,
reported
to
have
moved
in
at
once
for
priceless
photos
of
the
kill
,
rather
than
trying
to
help
,
takes
the
breath
away-although
there
are
precedents
for
it
in
the
mainstream
press
on
dramatic
occasions
in
the
past
.

But
the
hounding
,
harassing
role
of
these
ruthless
junkies
,
who
supply
the
tabloids
,
the
rest
of
the
media
and
the
public
with
the
photos
they
we
&LR;
all
simultaneously
seem
to
crave
and
denounce
is
a
separate
question
for
another
day
.

Physicists
have
found
strong
evidence
of
an
exotic
form
of
matter
that
does
n't
fall
into
any
of
the
familiar
categories
.

``
This
is
an
unusual
state
that
has
been
sort
of
expected
ever
since
the
quark
model
was
proposed
,
''
said
Notre
Dame
researcher
Neal
M.
Cason
.

``
People
will
now
begin
to
work
hard
trying
to
understand
what
's
going
on
.
''

All
the
heavy
matter
in
the
cosmos
is
made
up
of
particles
called
quarks
that
are
no
larger
than
a
billionth
of
a
billionth
of
an
inch
,
if
they
have
any
dimensions
at
all
.

Clusters
of
three
quarks
make
up
the
ordinary
protons
and
neutrons
.

Pairs
of
quarks
and
anti-quarks
the
anti-matter
counterpart
of
quarks
form
mesons
particles
that
can
be
created
and
studied
in
accelerators
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
after
a
subatomic
collision
.

But
in
Monday
's
issue
of
Physical
Review
Letters
,
Cason
and
colleagues
working
at
Brookhaven
National
Laboratory
on
Long
Island
report
evidence
for
a
``
hybrid
''
entity
that
apparently
contains
a
quark
,
an
anti-quark
and
a
gluon
the
particle
that
transmits
the
strong
nuclear
force
,
just
as
photons
carry
the
electromagnetic
force
.

Or
it
could
also
be
an
oddball
combination
of
two
quarks
and
two
anti-quarks
.

The
physicists
are
already
trying
to
determine
which
it
is
.

``
We
knew
something
like
this
had
to
exist
,
''
said
theorist
Chris
Quigg
of
Fermilab
,
and
``
it
's
nice
that
someone
has
seen
it
for
the
first
time
.
''

Surely
you
remember
Lava
Lite
Lamps
,
those
artifacts
of
1960s
coolness
whose
colored
globs
rise
and
fall
within
a
tapered
cylinder
,
heated
and
illuminated
by
a
bulb
below
.

Scientists
have
yoked
these
decorative
oddities
to
a
practical
purpose
:
generating
random
numbers
.

That
might
sound
just
as
useless
as
the
lamps
,
but
truly
random
numbers
are
an
invaluable
tool
in
the
science
of
cryptography
.

Many
forms
of
cryptography
depend
on
random
numbers
,
employed
as
``
seeds
''
to
encode
and
decode
.

Computers
are
often
used
for
this
task
but
the
numbers
they
generate
are
not
truly
random
.

The
digits
spring
from
set
functions
of
software
that
can
conceivably
be
replicated
.

Under
the
Lava
Lamp
system
,
dubbed
lavarand
by
Robert
G.
Mende
Jr.
,
Landon
Curt
Noll
and
Sanjeev
Sisodiya
of
Mountain
View
,
Calif.
,
computer
maker
Silicon
Graphics
,
an
array
of
six
lamps
operates
in
front
of
a
digital
camera
.

The
camera
shoots
a
picture
at
regular
intervals
and
converts
the
constantly
shifting
image
into
the
digital
language
of
computers
,
scrambling
the
data
in
the
process
.

The
translation
of
image
into
digits
is
broken
up
into
smaller
packets
;
the
scientists
scramble
that
``
seed
''
number
again
to
be
safe
.

Then
it
is
ready
to
be
used
in
the
encryption
program
.

The
work
is
displayed
on
the
World
Wide
Web
at
www.lavarand.sgi.com
&LR;
;
the
scientists
say
the
inspiration
for
the
effort
came
to
Mende
one
afternoon
while
he
``
was
avoiding
work
.
''

If
the
present
rate
of
increase
in
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
continues
,
the
results
could
completely
shut
down
the
Atlantic
Ocean
circulation
system
the
essential
marine
``
conveyor
belt
''
that
dominates
weather
patterns
in
America
and
Europe
.

That
is
the
ominous
conclusion
of
a
study
in
the
Aug.
28
issue
of
Nature
by
physicists
at
the
University
of
Bern
,
Switzerland
.

Normally
,
warm
and
very
salty
surface
water
from
the
equatorial
Atlantic
flows
north
until
it
hits
a
mass
of
cold
,
less-saline
water
around
Greenland
.

Then
it
cools
,
sinks
,
and
returns
toward
the
equator
far
beneath
the
surface
.

The
incoming
warm
water
has
some
big
advantages
.

It
sheds
its
heat
into
the
air
,
keeping
Europe
's
weather
comfortable
.

And
as
it
cools
,
it
absorbs
atmospheric
CO2
.

The
cooler
a
liquid
,
the
more
dissolved
gas
it
can
hold
.
If
CO2
emissions
continue
to
increase
at
the
present
rate
1
percent
per
year
for
several
more
decades
,
the
Swiss
scientists
'
computer
model
predicts
,
it
would
lead
to
``
irreversible
changes
''
as
the
water-mixing
stopped
.

Europe
's
weather
would
become
unstable
and
much
less
CO2
would
be
trapped
in
deep
ocean
water
.

But
reducing
the
rate
of
CO2
build-up
,
they
calculated
,
would
merely
slow
the
conveyor
belt
,
not
turn
if
off
.

So
policy-makers
should
``
take
into
account
critical
limits
on
the
rate
of
greenhouse-gas
increase
''
to
guard
against
climatic
catastrophe
,
they
conclude
.

In
the
Old
South
,
says
noted
Southern
chef
and
author
Edna
Lewis
,
the
most
memorable
dinners
often
started
with
whatever
happened
to
be
hanging
from
the
nearest
tree
branch
.

That
tradition
still
persists
in
parts
of
Appalachia
,
where
some
people
relish
squirrel
meat
and
consider
squirrel
brains
to
be
a
delicacy
.

But
now
this
exotic
dish
comes
with
a
warning
.

University
of
Kentucky
scientists
are
reporting
a
possible
link
between
eating
squirrel
brains
and
the
human
variant
of
``
mad
cow
disease
.
''

Neurologist
Joseph
Berger
,
in
the
Aug.
30
issue
of
the
British
medical
journal
The
Lancet
,
says
he
made
the
connection
while
researching
U.S.
cases
of
Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease
,
the
fatal
brain
illness
that
was
first
linked
to
British
beef
cattle
infected
with
mad
cow
disease
in
1986
.

Berger
and
colleagues
studied
the
diets
of
five
Kentucky
patients
who
developed
the
disease
and
discovered
that
all
had
a
history
of
eating
squirrel
brains
,
either
scrambled
with
eggs
or
cooked
in
a
stew
known
as
``
burgoo
.
''

The
finding
jibes
with
earlier
case
reports
that
suggested
that
the
disease
can
be
acquired
by
consuming
the
brains
of
infected
wild
animals
.

Additional
research
is
needed
to
confirm
the
link
,
Berger
says
.

In
the
meantime
,
he
says
,
caution
might
be
exercised
in
the
ingestion
of
the
arboreal
rodent
.

HALIFAX
COUNTY
,
Va.
.

Figuring
out
who
might
have
hit
the
state
's
$
26.2
million
lottery
jackpot
from
this
rural
Southside
county
has
become
something
of
a
whodunit
.

It
's
the
number
one
question
at
the
coffee
shop
,
the
barbershop
and
even
the
county
jail
here
.

Whoever
it
is
assuming
it
is
a
local
person
who
bought
the
lone
winning
ticket
in
Wednesday
's
drawing
will
instantly
vault
into
the
stratosphere
of
the
rich
and
famous
in
this
community
of
tobacco
farmers
and
textile
workers
on
the
North
Carolina
border
.

And
that
person
will
have
the
distinction
of
nailing
the
largest
Virginia
jackpot
won
on
a
single
ticket
.

``
I
could
make
it
on
that
,
''
said
mill
worker
Harold
Adams
,
59
,
sitting
in
Maxwell
's
Barber
Shop
,
where
you
can
still
get
a
shave
for
$
5
and
a
shower
for
$
2
.

``
There
's
a
lotta
people
mad
'cause
they
did
n't
win
.
''

Mickey
Wheeler
,
43
,
a
burly
county
jail
inmate
,
said
as
he
took
a
smoking
break
from
painting
the
county
courthouse
:
``
I
'd
buy
me
a
little
island
somewhere
.

I
'd
make
a
resort
and
make
money
.

Somewhere
in
the
Caribbean
.
''

The
winning
ticket
was
sold
at
Farmer
's
Foods
supermarket
in
the
town
of
Halifax
,
which
has
800
residents
and
extends
a
mile
from
the
railroad
tracks
at
one
end
to
the
Jiffy
Store
at
the
other
.

The
town
is
in
the
county
of
the
same
name
,
whose
30,000
residents
have
a
median
household
income
of
$
30,000
.

The
annual
prize
payment
alone
$
892,000
is
one-third
larger
than
the
town
's
budget
.

It
's
been
fun
for
folks
to
speculate
on
who
the
winner
might
be
:
a
nurse
at
the
regional
hospital
;
a
worker
at
the
Burlington
textile
mill
.

The
local
newspaper
reporter
spent
the
last
couple
of
days
trying
to
track
down
the
lucky
person
.

``
We
were
sort
of
looking
for
a
party
,
a
celebration
,
but
we
did
n't
find
it
,
''
said
Doug
Loftis
,
reporter
,
editor
and
layout
person
for
the
thrice-a-week
Gazette-Virginian
.

``
This
is
real
big
stuff
.

Everybody
wants
to
know
who
it
is
.
''

``
I
hear
the
girl
who
lives
right
above
me
won
it
,
''
said
retired
mill
worker
Charlie
Vaughan
,
68
.

The
winning
ticket
,
purchased
for
$
1
between
8
and
8:30
p.m.
Wednesday
,
likely
was
bought
by
a
local
person
,
said
Linda
Edmonds
,
Farmer
's
assistant
manager
.

Because
of
the
size
of
the
prize
,
the
store
was
selling
double
the
usual
number
of
tickets
the
night
of
the
drawing
,
``
but
most
of
the
customers
that
came
in
here
were
regular
local
customers
,
''
she
said
.

The
winner
ca
n't
claim
the
prize
before
Tuesday
,
when
the
Virginia
Lottery
office
reopens
after
the
holiday
.

When
Beverly
Wills
of
Huntsville
,
Ala.
,
saw
the
morning
headline
,
she
was
shocked
,
just
like
millions
of
others
.

Her
grief
moved
her
to
react
in
a
way
she
never
had
before
on
the
keyboard
of
her
computer
.

``
The
world
will
sorely
miss
her
!
''

Wills
,
a
47-year-old
civilian
Army
employee
,
typed
in
a
tribute
to
the
late
Princess
Diana
.

``
I
am
so
sorry
for
the
loss
her
sons
will
experience
!!

God
be
with
you
Diana
,
Princess
of
Wales
!
''

As
did
untold
thousands
of
others
around
the
world
,
Wills
posted
her
sympathy
card
to
one
of
the
several
memorial
pages
that
sprouted
almost
instantaneously
on
the
Internet
's
World
Wide
Web
,
providing
mourners
with
a
uniquely
personal
outlet
.

Major
news
events
routinely
prod
the
wired
community
to
take
to
their
terminals
to
join
spirited
debates
,
but
Diana
's
death
provoked
an
unusual
,
massive
outpouring
of
condolences
.

The
Internet
,
so
often
depicted
as
a
cold
,
perilous
sea
of
unreliable
information
,
became
a
comfort
medium
for
anyone
with
a
modem
.

``
It
was
a
means
to
express
what
I
was
feeling
,
''
said
Wills
,
who
,
like
other
Internet
users
,
ranked
Diana
's
death
as
having
an
emotional
impact
similar
to
the
assassination
of
John
F.
Kennedy
.

``
Normally
you
would
not
have
an
address
to
send
condolences
out
for
people
so
public
.

Or
to
do
it
so
quickly
.

In
Pleasantville
,
Calif.
,
Rene
Maher
,
34
,
switched
on
her
computer
Sunday
morning
before
turning
on
the
TV
news
,
and
soon
found
an
unofficial
memorial
page
to
which
she
posted
a
brief
note
.

``
I
was
determined
,
''
said
the
mother
of
three
.

``
I
just
feel
so
bad
for
her
children
.

It
seems
so
senseless
.
''

Maher
said
she
has
sent
such
condolence
notes
before
,
the
old-fashioned
way
,
most
recently
to
the
Kennedy
family
after
the
death
of
matriarch
Rose
Kennedy
.

``
I
feel
very
sad
when
someone
passes
who
is
of
great
significance
to
me
.
''

Net
users
could
sign
an
official
condolence
register
at
Buckingham
Palace
's
black-shrouded
Web
site
www.royal.gov.uk
&LR;
,
but
traffic
was
so
heavy
that
most
gave
up
and
posted
their
notes
on
unofficial
sites
,
which
promised
to
forward
them
to
the
royal
family
.

Poems
,
prayers
in
various
languages
,
quotes
from
Tennyson
and
Ovid
``
Our
souls
survive
this
death
''
were
among
the
tributes
on
the
site
at
www.etoile.demon.co.uk
&LR;
.

Throughout
cyberspace
,
the
general
tenor
of
discussion
was
the
same
as
off-line
:
shock
at
an
untimely
death
,
reverence
for
the
princess
``
the
British
Evita
,
''
one
anonymous
messager
called
her
and
seething
outrage
at
the
tabloid
photographers
who
bedeviled
her
.

``
The
ideal
penalty
,
''
proposed
a
subscriber
to
the
alt.talk.royalty
&LR;
discussion
group
,
would
be
``
that
of
Winston
Smith
near
the
end
of
the
novel
`
1984
.
'
''

Smith
's
face
was
gnawed
at
by
starving
rats
.

``
Humans
unite
and
boycott
ALL
tabloids
that
you
think
would
support
the
mosquitoes
that
follow
these
celebrities
,
''
blared
a
Web
page
urging
British
grocers
to
cease
the
sale
of
tabloid
papers
from
Sept.
5-12
.

``
Support
Princess
Diana
and
her
young
boys
.

Do
n't
support
her
murderers
!
''

Naturally
,
in
various
global
chat
rooms
,
a
conspiratorial
mind-set
had
already
taken
hold
.

On
the
Internet
's
Usenet
bulletin
board
,
someone
quickly
created
the
alt.conspiracy.princess-diana
&LR;
discussion
group
.

The
topic
engendering
the
most
debate
was
titled
``
Not
the
whole
truth
about
cause
of
accident
?
''

The
bizarre
speculation
ranged
from
a
palace
plot
to
a
hit
by
the
British
intelligence
agency
,
MI6
.

The
following
editorial
appeared
in
Monday
's
Los
Angeles
Times
:
The
shocking
death
of
Princess
Diana
has
raised
disturbing
questions
about
the
symbiotic
and
sometimes
sick
relationship
between
celebrities
and
the
tabloid
media
.

The
accusatory
fingers
are
out
,
and
the
bluntest
criticism
was
articulated
by
Princess
Diana
's
brother
,
Earl
Charles
Spencer
:
``
I
always
believed
the
press
would
kill
her
in
the
end
''
;
editors
and
publishers
who
paid
for
intrusive
pictures
have
``
blood
on
their
hands
.
''

But
it
's
not
quite
that
simple
.

Police
in
Paris
,
where
Princess
Diana
,
her
companion
,
Dodi
Fayed
,
and
a
driver
were
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
,
are
questioning
the
seven
photographers
said
to
have
been
pursuing
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
high-speed
crash
.

If
it
can
be
shown
that
the
photographers
'
pursuit
helped
cause
the
crash
,
then
they
should
be
prosecuted
as
any
other
irresponsible
driver
would
be
.

It
is
indeed
disgusting
to
hear
eyewitness
reports
that
some
of
the
paparazzi
who
may
have
helped
cause
the
accident
scrambled
to
take
photos
of
the
death
scene
and
its
victims
even
before
help
could
arrive
.

The
tragedy
is
a
nightmare
for
many
of
the
rich
and
famous
who
also
have
been
aggressively
pursued
by
celebrity
photographers
.

Hard-to-get
photos
such
as
``
The
Kiss
''
picture
of
Princess
Diana
and
Fayed
reportedly
garnered
as
much
as
$
3
million
worldwide
from
the
tabloids
.

Thus
the
feeding
frenzy
that
surrounded
their
every
move
.

Arnold
Schwarzenegger
and
wife
Maria
Shriver
were
chased
by
photographers
as
they
took
their
son
to
school
one
day
last
spring
;
a
minor
collision
resulted
and
the
Schwarzenegger
auto
briefly
was
wedged
between
two
cars
.

The
photographers
were
charged
with
misdemeanors
.

Alec
Baldwin
and
his
wife
,
Kim
Basinger
,
were
confronted
by
a
photographer
as
they
brought
their
newborn
daughter
home
.

Baldwin
attempted
to
stop
the
photographer
and
later
was
acquitted
of
misdemeanor
battery
charges
.

Tom
Cruise
,
who
said
he
's
been
chased
in
the
same
tunnel
where
Princess
Diana
was
fatally
injured
,
thinks
there
ought
to
be
laws
to
control
paparazzi
.

Obviously
no
one
has
the
right
to
trespass
on
private
property
or
conduct
dangerous
automotive
pursuits
.

There
are
already
laws
against
that
.

Beyond
the
legalities
,
the
entertainment
media
should
reject
the
anything-goes
tactics
that
are
employed
by
some
paparazzi
.

But
the
celebrity
industry
machine
the
one
that
relentlessly
promotes
stars
and
is
all
too
happy
to
bask
in
free
publicity
to
make
mega-bucks
for
their
latest
project
also
needs
to
consider
how
it
can
help
rein
in
a
monster
it
helped
create
.

Finally
,
those
of
us
who
shell
out
the
money
to
buy
the
tabloid
newspapers
or
who
watch
the
television
peekaboo
shows
also
must
ask
what
small
part
we
all
play
in
contributing
to
an
out-of-whack
preoccupation
with
celebrities
.

As
one
sad
reporter
in
London
commented
Sunday
morning
:
``
The
tabloid
press
is
disparaged
by
many
,
and
read
by
many
more
.
''

This
used
to
be
the
dead
season
,
a
time
between
citrus
and
tomato
harvests
when
idle
farm
workers
had
little
to
do
but
wait
for
towering
afternoon
thunderstorms
to
rumble
in
from
the
Everglades
and
clear
the
air
of
dust
.

Fired
up
by
a
crop
reputed
to
be
a
sexual
stimulant
and
antidote
to
enlarged
prostates
,
New
Market
Road
is
lined
with
roadside
buyers
,
standing
behind
hand-lettered
signs
reading
``
Se
compra
bolita
''
and
waving
stacks
of
cash
at
pickers
who
cruise
by
in
trucks
and
vans
loaded
with
sacks
of
splotchy
yellow
berries
.

``
Twenty-four
cents
a
pound
,
''
the
buyers
were
calling
at
one
point
last
week
,
citing
that
hour
's
price
.

The
bolita
``
little
ball
''
in
Spanish
is
the
berry
of
the
saw
palmetto
,
a
low-growing
,
shrublike
palm
that
may
be
the
most
common
plant
in
all
Florida
and
,
after
an
act
of
the
Legislature
,
the
state
's
newest
cash
crop
.

Raw
,
the
ripened
olive-sized
berries
of
the
saw
palmetto
,
are
virtually
inedible
,
with
an
acrid
taste
that
a
European
sailor
shipwrecked
in
Florida
in
the
1600s
described
as
being
like
``
rotten
cheese
steeped
in
tobacco
juice
.
''

Dried
and
processed
,
however
,
so
that
its
extract
can
be
swallowed
as
a
capsule
or
taken
as
an
herbal
tea
,
the
saw
palmetto
is
finding
an
enormous
market
.

About
half
of
all
men
older
than
50
,
for
example
,
have
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
,
a
noncancerous
condition
that
can
inhibit
urinary
and
sexual
function
.

Scientific
evidence
of
saw
palmetto
's
effects
is
scarce
.

A
recent
pilot
study
of
50
men
conducted
at
the
University
of
Chicago
School
of
Medicine
found
about
half
reported
at
least
50
percent
improvement
in
symptoms
involving
urinary
problems
,
according
to
urologist
Glenn
S.
Gerber
.

``
Some
of
that
could
be
the
placebo
effect
,
''
Gerber
said
.

``
But
my
patients
use
it
and
think
it
's
the
greatest
.

I
'm
encouraged
enough
to
pursue
it
further
.
''

Some
scientists
and
physicians
have
expressed
doubt
about
the
reputed
benefits
of
saw
palmetto
,
citing
a
lack
of
rigorous
clinical
studies
.

But
Gerber
points
out
that
American
pharmaceutical
companies
a
chief
source
of
research
funding
are
unlikely
to
sponsor
studies
of
saw
palmetto
because
several
synthetic
drugs
used
to
treat
BPH
are
already
on
the
market
.

Even
without
scientific
evidence
of
its
efficacy
,
however
,
saw
palmetto
is
a
hot
alternative
medicine
riding
a
wave
of
word-of-mouth
publicity
.

Many
think
that
wave
is
going
to
build
.

``
As
the
baby
boom
generation
reaches
that
50-plus
plateau
and
becomes
worried
about
their
prostates
,
interest
in
saw
palmetto
is
just
going
to
grow
,
''
said
Jeff
Mullahey
,
a
range
scientist
at
the
University
of
Florida
's
research
station
here
who
has
been
studying
the
plant
.

``
I
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
business
.
''

Just
how
big
that
business
will
be
,
however
,
is
not
known
.

This
year
the
harvest
is
expected
to
yield
some
2,000
tons
of
dried
saw
palmetto
from
berries
picked
in
Florida
,
most
from
open
range
land
in
the
southwest
and
central
parts
of
the
state
,
and
dealers
estimate
the
value
of
the
crop
at
about
$
50
million
.

From
local
processors
,
manufacturers
of
dietary
supplements
here
and
in
Europe
buy
both
powdered
and
oil
extract
from
pulverized
berries
.

Drug
companies
in
France
and
Germany
use
saw
palmetto
in
a
drug
that
has
been
prescribed
for
years
to
treat
benign
prostate
enlargement
.

In
the
United
States
,
the
extract
is
turned
into
capsules
that
are
sold
in
health
food
stores
under
more
than
a
dozen
brand
names
.

Saw
palmetto
can
not
be
prescribed
as
a
drug
in
the
United
States
without
years
of
clinical
trials
and
approval
from
the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.

But
companies
such
as
Nature
's
Herbs
,
which
market
the
drug
,
can
claim
that
it
``
nutritionally
supports
healthy
prostate
function
.
''

Depending
on
strength
,
prices
for
a
30-day
supply
range
from
$
14
to
$
21
.

Consuming
saw
palmetto
berries
as
food
or
for
its
medicinal
benefits
is
not
new
.

According
to
Bradley
C.
Bennett
,
an
ethnobotanist
at
Florida
International
University
in
Miami
,
pre-Colombian
inhabitants
of
South
Florida
and
American
Indians
who
came
later
included
the
berries
in
their
regular
diet
.

In
the
early
1900s
,
Miami
settlers
mixed
juice
from
the
berries
with
carbonated
water
and
sold
its
as
a
drink
called
``
metto
.
''

In
the
lore
of
folk
medicine
,
the
fatty
acids
in
saw
palmetto
berries
were
believed
to
act
as
an
aphrodisiac
,
diuretic
and
a
sedative
.

The
fruit
was
also
eaten
to
treat
diarrhea
,
bronchitis
and
to
aid
digestion
.

End
optional
trim
The
Florida
Legislature
's
declaration
of
saw
palmetto
as
a
cash
crop
means
that
penalties
could
be
levied
against
those
convicted
of
poaching
,
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture
could
assist
with
marketing
the
crop
at
growers
'
request
.

So
far
,
that
has
not
happened
,
said
Ted
Helms
,
the
department
's
marketing
bureau
chief
.

``
But
this
is
undergoing
rapid
growth
,
''
he
said
of

``

I

WASHINGTON
They
left
town
on
a
bipartisan
high
after
reaching
a
historic
compact
with
the
White
House
to
balance
the
federal
budget
while
cutting
taxes
.

But
as
members
of
Congress
return
to
work
this
week
from
their
August
recess
,
their
summer
of
love
appears
likely
to
beget
an
autumn
of
trench
warfare
.

The
budget
deal
,
in
fact
,
may
have
made
a
partisan
bloodletting
inevitable
by
blurring
the
philosophical
distinctions
between
the
two
parties
.

Many
rank-and-file
Democrats
and
Republicans
are
clearly
eager
to
sharpen
their
political
differences
as
another
election
year
approaches
,
one
in
which
control
of
Congress
will
be
at
stake
especially
the
House
,
where
the
GOP
holds
a
slim
21-seat
margin
.

``
The
mayhem
and
bickering
are
about
to
return
and
just
in
time
,
''
said
Paul
Gigot
,
an
influential
right-of-center
commentator
.

``
The
era
of
bipartisanship
is
over
precisely
because
of
the
budget
deal
.

...
Let
the
brawling
begin
.
''

The
appetite
for
ideology-driven
combat
should
quickly
manifest
itself
as
both
houses
focus
on
the
most
pressing
business
at
hand
:
enacting
the
13
big
appropriations
bills
needed
to
keep
the
government
running
.

Those
measures
,
which
follow
the
broad
outlines
of
the
balanced-budget
legislation
,
must
be
passed
and
signed
by
President
Clinton
by
Oct.
1
,
the
start
of
the
new
federal
fiscal
year
.

Otherwise
the
government
must
shut
down
,
unless
all
parties
agree
to
a
``
continuing
resolution
''
to
keep
the
government
in
operation
.

So
far
,
the
House
has
finished
work
on
eight
of
the
13
bills
,
and
the
Senate
10
.

But
not
one
has
reached
the
Oval
Office
.

Complicating
the
task
is
the
new
presidential
line-item
veto
authority
,
which
Clinton
has
already
used
to
kill
three
provisions
in
the
balanced-budget
legislation
.

``
As
they
sit
down
to
hash
things
out
,
one
of
the
things
the
appropriators
will
want
is
assurances
from
the
White
House
that
the
president
wo
n't
use
the
line-item
veto
.

And
that
's
going
to
eat
up
most
of
September
,
''
Mason
predicted
.

In
addition
,
if
Congress
intends
to
override
Clinton
's
previous
line-item
vetoes
,
it
has
30
days
to
act
.

Also
,
Clinton
's
line-item
veto
authority
almost
certainly
will
face
a
legal
challenge
.

Among
the
major
issues
Congress
is
expected
to
quickly
take
up
is
a
presidential
request
for
``
fast-track
''
authority
to
negotiate
multilateral
trade
treaties
.

The
legislation
would
allow
such
pacts
to
get
an
up-or-down
vote
within
90
days
,
without
being
encumbered
by
amendments
.

This
authority
expired
at
the
end
of
1994
.

Another
high-priority
item
is
the
Intermodal
Surface
Transportation
Efficiency
Act
,
which
expires
Sept.
30
.

Lawmakers
representing
competing
regional
interests
will
have
to
agree
on
how
to
divvy
up
$
157
billion
in
assorted
transportation
programs
around
the
country
.

Also
awaiting
congressional
action
is
the
proposed
$
368.5
illion
legal
settlement
between
the
tobacco
industry
and
state
attorneys
general
.

Beyond
those
issues
,
GOP
congressional
leaders
are
divided
over
what
to
do
if
anything
.

House
Appropriations
Committee
Chairman
Bob
Livingston
,
R-La.
,
would
like
to
get
the
13
funding
measures
enacted
and
then
adjourn
for
the
year
,
allowing
members
to
go
home
and
boast
about
their
accomplishments
.

``
Rather
than
stomping
on
our
own
lines
,
we
ought
to
just
relax
awhile
.

We
've
had
a
good
year
;
this
is
a
crowning
achievement
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
enactment
of
the
five-year
balanced-budget
accord
.

But
some
congressional
GOP
strategists
,
including
House
Speaker
Newt
Gingrich
,
are
contemplating
``
broad
themes
''
to
be
articulated
in
the
run-up
to
the
off-year
elections
.

``
I
believe
we
will
have
a
vision
in
September
and
October
that
...
will
move
us
into
the
'98
campaign
with
a
clear
choice
for
America
's
future
.

That
will
set
the
stage
for
the
2000
campaign
,
''
Gingrich
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
National
Journal
magazine
.

Not
everyone
foresees
an
autumn
filled
with
discord
.

``
I
actually
do
n't
anticipate
the
kind
of
utter
collapse
and
partisan
warfare
that
some
see
,
''
said
Thomas
E.
Mann
,
director
of
governmental
studies
at
the
Brookings
Institution
.

``
That
does
n't
serve
in
Clinton
's
interest
or
the
Republican
majority
's
interest
.

The
13
funding
bills
,
because
of
their
must-pass
nature
,
already
are
attracting
an
array
of
controversial
amendments
,
on
issues
ranging
from
abortion
to
arts
funding
.

Any
one
could
cause
prolonged
wrangling
.

The
funding
bill
for
the
departments
of
Labor
,
Education
and
Health
and
Human
Services
,
for
instance
,
faces
two
abortion-related
amendments
in
the
House
.

One
would
require
minors
to
obtain
parental
consent
before
getting
services
from
federally
funded
clinics
;
the
other
would
extend
the
prohibition
on
federally
funded
abortions
to
managed-care
plans
under
Medicaid
.

Meanwhile
,
a
House-passed
appropriations
bill
would
end
all
spending
for
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
.

But
it
must
be
reconciled
in
a
conference
committee
with
the
Senate
bill
,
which
contains
$
100
million
for
the
NEA
.

The
defense
appropriations
bill
,
as
passed
by
the
House
,
bars
funds
for
U.S.
troops
in
Bosnia
after
June
30
,
1998
a
prohibition
that
is
likely
to
provoke
a
Clinton
veto
.

The
Senate
version
does
not
contain
the
provision
.

Two
festering
disputes
over
contested
election
results
could
generate
some
of
the
most
partisan
rancor
.

House
and
Senate
Democrats
alike
have
threatened
to
disrupt
all
legislative

stop
investigating
alleged

over

Bicameral
disruptions
also
could
occur
over
campaign
finance
reform
.

Advocates
have
threatened
to
gum
up
the
works
unless

their
request
to
allocate
floor
time
for
a

the
nation
's
election
financing
laws
.

So
far
,
GOP
leaders
in
both
chambers
have
refused
to
do
so
.

A
further
breakdown
of
bipartisanship
looms
with
resumption
of
hearings
on
campaign
fund-raising
activities
by
the
Senate
Governmental
Affairs
Committee
.

The
House
Government
Reform

,
chaired
by
partisan
firebrand
Dan
Burton
,
R-Ind.
,
is
expected
to

of
newly

In

Whatever

During
the
darkest
days
of
apartheid
,
Mamphela
Ramphele
,
a
young
black
physician
,
was
detained
without
trial
and
banished
to
a
remote
,
rural
area
of
South
Africa
by
the
white
authorities
.

She
was
there
,
20
years
ago
this
September
,
when
she
learned
that
Black
Consciousness
leader
Steven
Biko
had
died
in
police
custody
.

Their
child
,
Hlumelo
,
was
born
a
few
months
later
.

His
name
means
``
the
shoot
that
grew
from
a
dead
tree
trunk
.
''

So
much
has
changed
in
South
Africa
since
Biko
's
death
in
1977
.

The
black
majority
now
controls
its
destiny
in
a
democracy
.

And
Biko
's
friend
and
lover
,
Mamphela
Ramphele
,
now
49
,
is
vice
chancellor
of
the
University
of
Cape
Town
,
the
first
black
person
to
run
the
nation
's
leading
research
institution
.

Three
former
police
officers
have
asked
the
nation
's
Truth
and
Reconciliation
Commission
for
amnesty
in
Biko
's
death
.

The
commission
``
is
courageously
dealing
with
the
past
,
''
Ramphele
says
.

But
,
she
adds
,
``
nothing
can
deal
adequately
with
loss
and
pain
.
''

Ramphele
is
a
rarity
among
leaders
in
her
homeland
a
highly
educated
black
woman
who
commands
respect
and
real
power
in
academia
and
beyond
.

What
also
sets
her
apart
is
her
political
independence
.

She
is
not
a
member
of
the
African
National
Congress
or
any
other
party
.

Instead
,
she
is
a
product
of
Black
Consciousness
,
the
current
in
black
political
thought
that
reached
its
peak
in
South
Africa
under
Biko
.

Ramphele
remains
a
critical
observer
as
well
as
a
crucial
player
in
the
new
South
Africa
.

In
addition
to
running
the
university
,
she
is
a
renowned
expert
on
rural
poverty
,
a
member
of
the
boards
of
directors
of
several
companies
and
the
single
mother
of
two
sons
.

She
earned
a
medical
degree
in
1972
from
the
University
of
Natal
,
where
she
was
active
in
the
Black
Consciousness
Movement
.

By
the
time
she
was
banished
in
1977
,
she
had
founded
two
community
health
centers
.

During
her
seven
years
under
the
banning
order
,
she
launched
a
day-care
center
,
a
literacy
project
and
a
communal
vegetable
garden
in
the
northern
Transvaal
.

Later
,
she
earned
a
doctoral
degree
in
anthropology
,
taught
at
the
University
of
Cape
Town
and
conducted
ground-breaking
research
on
migrant
workers
and
township
children
and
teen-agers
.

She
was
appointed
one
of
the
university
's
four
deputy
vice
chancellors
in
1991
and
became
head
of
the
school
last
year
.

Question
:
The
Truth
and
Reconciliation
Commission
has
held
South
Africans
enthralled
for
months
with
appeals
for
amnesty
from
blacks
as
well
as
whites
.

Is
it
helping
the
country
turn
the
corner
on
its
past
?

Answer
:
It
is
the
best
mechanism
for
dealing
with
the
complex
legacy
of
pain
,
resentment
and
failure
to
acknowledge
other
people
's
pain
.

The
TRC
is
the
world
's
first
,
in
courageously
dealing
with
the
past
.

But
nothing
can
really
deal
adequately
with
loss
and
pain
.

Q
:
It
has
been
three
years
since
the
first
all-race
elections
in
South
Africa
.

How
is
the
country
doing
today
?

A
:
If
you
are
judging
by
the
distance
from
which
we
have
come
,
we
've
done
very
well
.

But
if
you
judge
it
by
how
far
we
still
have
to
go
,
then
we
are
really
struggling
.

The
success
stories
have
been
the
absolutely
superb
constitution
with
...
a
wonderful
bill
of
rights
and
very
good
provisions
in
terms
of
equality
,
including
gender
equality
.

Q
:
And
where
have
things
not
gone
well
?

A
:
The
major
difficulty
has
been
the
poor
human
capital
we
inherited
.

Q
:
But
does
n't
South
Africa
have
more
human
capital
than
other
countries
in
Africa
?

A
:
At
the
top
level
,
the
education
is
fine
.

But
it
's
not
good
enough
for
running
a
modern
economy
.

The
problem
was
the
nature
of
the
liberation
struggle
.

From
1976
through
1994
,
very
little
real
education
happened
in
poor
African
township
areas
.

And
the
chickens
of
that
are
coming
home
to

with
a
vengeance
young
,
20
-
to
30-year-old
people
who
have
participated
very
actively
in
the
liberation
process
and
now
feel
society
owes
them
something
.

And
indeed
we
do
.

But
how
do
you
begin
to
repay
people
?

Q
:
One
major
concern
from
the
beginning
has
been
how
President
Mandela
would
be
able
to
deal
with
the
aspirations
of
black
freedom
fighters
who
feel
entitled
.

A
:
I
do
n't
think
anyone
feels
entitled
to
sitting
down
and
receiving
money
.

They
do
feel
entitled
to
opportunities
,
which
is
quite
legitimate
.

But
when
you
have
a
government
that
is
struggling
to
deal
with
...
housing
backlogs
,
educational
inadequacies
,
job
creation
and
infrastructure
development
it
's
really
a
mammoth
task
.

Begin
optional
trim
Q
:
How
does
that
play
out
at
the
University
of
Cape
Town
?

A
:
We
are
doing
better
than
any
university
not
only
in
bringing
people
in
,
but
in
transforming
the
university
into
a
truly
African
university
that
can
respond
to
the
needs
of
society
as
well
as
promote
excellence
.

Since
the
early
1980s
,
there
has
been
a
steady
growth
in
the
number
of
black
students
,
from
under
10
percent
in
the
'80s
to
now
46
percent
.

And
the
growth
has
been
in
the
critical
areas
of
science
,
engineering
,
medicine
and
commerce
.

Q
:
When
you
talk
about
the
human
capital
void
,
who
is
filling
it
now
?

Or
is
it
simply
not
being
filled
?

A
:
In
some
cases
it
's
not
being
filled
.

Particularly
in
the
government
sector
and
in
many
areas
of
civic
life
.

In
the
private
sector
,
it
is
filled
by
attracting
foreigners
.

Part
of
the
problem
is
that
South
Africa
has
suffered
from
the
influence
of
the
British
,
who
felt
that
to
be
skilled
meant
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
and
wear
a
tie
and
suit
,
rather
than
also
to
be
able
to
work
with
your
hands
.

We
are
a
nation
that
really
needs
to
be
shaken
into
a
completely
new
path
in
terms
of
skills
and
production
.

End
optional
trim
Q
:
Is
there
a
feeling
of
disappointment
if
that
's
not
too
strong
among
blacks
?

A
:
Disappointment
is
not
too
strong
a
word
.

But
you
've
got
to
look
at
different
sectors
.

Many
black
South
Africans
have
done
extraordinarily
well
.

Some
of
them
have
become
millionaires
because
they
've
made
deals
with
foreign
investors
and
former
white
companies
trying
to
look
right
in
the
new
political
environment
.

And
when
you
look
at
the
black
professional
class
,
there
is
no
disappointment
there
.

They
are
doing
very
well
.

But
then
when
you
go
below
that
,
you
begin
to
meet
a
lot
of
anxiety
.

More
and
more
middle-class
people
have
to
pay
more
and
more
money
to
give
their
kids
the
type
of
education
that
will
give
them
opportunities
in
the
future
.

You
get
even
more
frustration
among
the
working-class
people
,
who
have
been
waiting
for
houses
,
clinics
and
schools
.

There
has
been
some
progress
,
but
nothing
equal
to
the
enormous
challenges
and
expectations
.

Below
that
,
with
the
unemployed
,
it
's
not
just
disappointment
but
anger
and
frustration
.

I
've
never
seen
such
high
levels
of
incest
,
of
rape
.

It
's
totally
frightening
.

Q
:
And
for
whites
?

A
:
White
people
have
done
extraordinarily
well
.

They
had
their
fingers
in
butter
in
the
past
,
and
they
still
have
it
in
thick
cream
.

Their
properties
are
still
intact
.

Their
children
have
been
educated
.

There
is
a
problem
with
jobs
.

It
is
not
because
of
discrimination
;
there
are
just
too
few
jobs
.

And
if
a
company
has
not
hired
black
people
in
the
past
it
's
only
logical
that
it
will
start
by
hiring
them
.

So
there
is
that
anxiety
.

But
many
young
white
graduates
are
highly
mobile
.

Some
have
left
the
country
.

I
do
n't
think
I
can
weep
for
them
.

And
of
course
you
have
a
lot
of
whites
who
are
very
committed
to
making
the
new
system
work
.

In
fact
,
I
think
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
the
new
government
has
been
in
not
taking
advantage
of
offers
of
support
from
whites
.

Q
:
Mandela
has
said
he
will
not
run
for
re-election
.

What
is
the
post-Mandela
future
?

A
:
That
future
is
beginning
to
be
the
dominant
present
because
Mandela
has
almost
opted
out
of
active
government
.

Deputy
President
Thabo
Mbeki
is
the
person
running
the
government
,
for
better
or
for
worse
.

Mandela
is
becoming
more
and
more
of
a
symbolic
figure
.

That
is
not
a
bad
thing
.

Mandela
is
a
kind
of
Moses
,
the
person
who
brings
you
out
of
the
wilderness
.

But
he
's
not
an
institutional
man
.

He
uses
his
personal
appeal
and
charm
in
relationships
,
be
they
foreign
or
national
.

But
I
do
n't
think
you
can
have
a
democracy
run
that
way
.

Q
:
Sexism
was
a
feature
of
the
old
South
Africa
.

What
is
the
role
of
black
women
in
the
new
South
Africa
?

A
:
As
African
countries
go
,
we
've
done
very
well
,
in
part
because
of
the
benefit
of
the
experiences
of
other
countries
,
which
got
ANC
women
to
realize
that
simply
being
part
of
the
majority
party
is
not
going
to
ensure
their
empowerment
Mandela
has
been
been
very
active
in
making
sure
that
women
not
only
got
into
Parliament
,
but
that
they
got
into
the
Cabinet
.

But
that
's
not
good
enough
.

Even
within
the
ANC
,
the
dominant
power
still
lies
in
the
hands
of
men
.

Q
:
And
outside
the
political
arena
?

A
:
In
everyday
life
,
that
is
where
the
real
crunch
is
going
to
have
to
be
.

Whether
you
are
looking
at
universities
or
the
private
sector
,
there
really
is
n't
much
movement
.

Optional
add
end
Q
:
Although
you
're
not
a
member
of
a
political
party
,
do
you
maintain
your
belief
in
the
core
values
of
Black
Consciousness
?

A
:
The
Black
Consciousness
movement
was
never
really
an
opposition
party
.

It
was
a
movement
intended
to
enable
black
people
to
assert
themselves
in
a
political
environment
in
which
being
black
meant
being
inferior
.

That
need
will
continue
to
be
there
until
such
time
as
South
Africans
stop
seeing
themselves
in
terms
of
black
and
white
.

Q
:
And
the
ANC
's
record
on
racism
?

A
:
The
ANC
has
fudged
that
issue
.

The
ANC
says
all
its
members
are
important
,
whether
black
or
white
,
and
that
race
does
n't
matter
.

Well
,
it
does
matter
.

Because
when
the
ANC
is
criticized
for
incompetence
the
first
thing
it
says
is
:
`
Oh
,
you
're
criticizing
us
because
you
're
white
and
we
're
black
.

You
ca
n't
stand
black
people
being
in
positions
of
authority
.
'

I
think
that
's
a
sign
of
feelings
of
inferiority
.

Why
must
you
assume
that
because
you
are
being
criticized
,
it
's
because
you
are
black
?

So
we
still
have
that
problem
.

I
think
racism
will
continue
to
be
a
shadow
over
South
Africa
,
and
we
have
to
confront
it
directly
and
deal
with
it
both
in
black
people
and
in
the
white
people
who
still
assume
that
somehow
we
must
adjust
to
them
because
,
as
they
put
it
,
`
there
is
no
other
future
.
'

It
will
remain
an
ongoing
struggle
until
both
black
and
white
are
comfortable
with
the
fact
that
we
are
members
of
one
common
race
,
which
is
the
human
race
.

WASHINGTON
The
Defense
Department
hopes
to
set
up
a
special
three-level
personnel
system
for
its
790,000
civilians
.

The
plan
,
which
must
get
White
House
approval
before
going
to
Congress
,
would
give
Army
,
Navy
,
Air
Force
and
other
Defense
agencies
streamlined
authority
to
hire
,
fire
,
pay
and
promote
workers
.

Many
new
workers
would
be
hired
on
short-term
contracts
.

Others
might
be
offered
the
choice
of
getting
a
bigger
paycheck
in
return
for
reduced
benefits
.

Senior
civilian
brass
will
meet
Friday
to
review
the
proposal
and
discuss
how
to
present
it
to
Congress
.

The
Defense
Department
often
is
the
first
federal
agency
to
seek
and
get
major
personnel
changes
.

The
federal
buyout
program
,
for
example
,
first
was
tested
in
the
Defense
Department
.

In
brief
,
the
proposal
would
:
Free
the
Defense
Department
from
many
of
the
rules
and
constraints
of
the
civil-service
system
.

Keep
a
``
cadre
of
permanent
career
employees
''
under
existing
civil-service
retirement
programs
.

Many
,
if
not
most
,
future
hires
would
come
in
under
the
proposed
new
system
with
different
rules
and
benefits
.

Both
groups
would
perform
functions
that
are
considered
permanent
and
not
subject
to
major
cutbacks
or
increases
because
of
changes
in
budget
or
mission
.

Create
a
new
group
of
``
non-permanent
''
employees
hired
for
a
maximum
of
five
years
.

They
would
get
health
and
life-insurance
coverage
but
would
n't
automatically
be
included
in
the
federal
retirement
system
.

The
group
also
would
serve
as
a
potential
``
recruitment
pool
''
when
new
permanent
hires
were
needed
.

Rely
to
an
even-greater
extent
on
outside
contractors
to
perform
work
``
determined
to
be
non-governmental
in
nature
and
more
cost
effective
to
outsource
or
privatize-in-place
.
''

Set
salaries
outside
of
the
regular
civil-service
pay
bands
and
grade
structure
and
allow
the
department
to
hire
and
fire
more
quickly
to
meet
special
skill
requirements
.

The
working
paper
that
Defense
Department
brass
will
get
at
the
Friday
briefing
says
in
part
that
the
civilian
work
force
``
currently
costs
...
$
41.58
billion
annually
.

It
is
a
well-qualified
,
motivated
and
diverse
workforce
.

However
,
continued
downsizing
coupled
with
new
skill
requirements
generated
by
emerging
techhnologies
presents
special
workforce
challenges
.

These
include
an
older
,
more-senior
workforce
caused
by
limited
accessions
,
multiple
reductions
in
force
and
demographic
forces
''
that
have
created
a
shortage
of
skills
in
many
areas
.

The
working
paper
proposes
a
system
to
give
Defense
``
the
flexibility
to
size
its
civilian
workforce
using
simplified
recruitment
,
classification
and
pay
,
''
as
well
as
its
own
``
separation
policies
and
procedures
.
''

In
English
,
that
means
streamlined
firing
and
layoff
procedures
.

Defense
is
the
most
downsized
and
reinvented
operation
in
government
.

Nearly
30
percent
of
its
federal
civilian
jobs
have
been
eliminated
,
through
either
base
closings
or
the
administration
's
downsizing
program
.

Most
of
the
250,000
federal
job
cuts
implemented
by
the
Clinton
administration
involved
Defense
personnel
.

Most
of
the
maximum
$
25,000
buyouts
paid
to
retirement-age
employees
went
to
middle
-
and
senior-level
Defense
civilian
employees
.

Most
of
the
reductions
in
force
layoffs
over
the
last
five
years
hit
Defense
civilian
employees
.

As
a
result
,
Defense
like
many
other
federal
agencies
finds
itself
short
of
experts
in
important
in-house
operations
such
as
personnel
offices
,
management
of
benefits
and
retirement
counseling
.

PARIS
The
driver
of
the
Mercedes
sedan
carrying
Princess
Diana
was
legally
drunk
when
he
crashed
in
a
roadway
tunnel
here
early
Sunday
,
killing
Diana
,
companion
Dodi
Fayed
and
himself
,
the
Paris
prosecutor
's
office
said
Monday
.

The
announcement
did
not
specify
his
blood
alcohol
level
,
but
news
agencies
quoted
official
sources
as
saying
it
was
three
times
the
legal
limit
for
drivers
in
France
.

The
driver
,
who
was
identified
Monday
as
Henri
Paul
,
41
,
had
been
trained
in
close-quarter
driving
on
the
same
type
of
Mercedes
he
was
handling
the
night
of
the
accident
.

Paul
was
assistant
security
director
at
the
Hotel
Ritz
,
where
Diana
and
Fayed
ate
their
last
dinner
.

The
decision
that
he
would
chauffeur
the
couple
was
made
at
the
last
minute
,
according
to
a
Fayed
family
lawyer
who
said
Paul
was
called
in
from
home
late
in
the
evening
.

Lawyers
for
paparazzi
photographers
who
were
following
the
speeding
car
argued
that
the
revelation
shifted
responsibility
from
the
cameramen
,
who
have
been
widely
blamed
for
causing
the
accident
.

This
``
may
modify
a
lot
of
things
,
''
said
William
Bourdon
,
lawyer
for
photographer
Nicolas
Arsov
of
the
SIPA
press
agency
.

``
This
explains
that
crazy
speed
.
''

Widespread
reports
here
have
said
the
sedan
,
a
Mercedes
S-280
,
was
traveling
at
a
speed
of
at
least
90
mph
in
a
30-mph
zone
when
it
struck
a
concrete
pillar
in
the
tunnel
under
the
Alma
bridge
in
central
Paris
,
and
possibly
much
faster
.

Reports
Monday
said
the
car
's
speedometer
was
frozen
at
196
kilometers
per
hour
,
or
121
mph
.

However
,
the
Paris
prosecutor
's
office
said
Monday
it
plans
to
begin
proceedings
Tuesday
against
some
or
all
of
the
seven
photographers
whom
police
have
been
holding
for
questioning
since
the
accident
.

Bernard
Dartevelle
,
a
lawyer
for
Mohamed
Al
Fayed
,
Dodi
Fayed
's
wealthy
businessman
father
and
also
the
owner
of
the
Hotel
Ritz
,
said
the
revelation
``
changes
absolutely
nothing
.
''

He
spoke
of
an
``
ambience
of
harassment
''
created
around
Diana
and
Fayed
by
the
constant
presence
of
paparazzi
.

``
The
Ritz
had
to
organize
their
departure
under
special
conditions
...
to
have
the
regular
chauffeur
drive
an
empty
vehicle
and
ask
another
driver
to
take
the
wheel
of
this
one
,
''
Dartevelle
said
.

``
There
is
incontestably
a
causal
link
between
the
drama
and
the
pursuit
by
the
journalists
.

If
the
journalists
had
not
been
present
,
if
they
had
not
organized
the
pursuit
,
we
would
n't
have
had
to
send
a
decoy
,
we
would
n't
have
had
to
turn
to
another
driver
and
he
would
n't
have
been
speeding
.
''

News
agencies
quoted
prosecutors
as
saying
Paul
's
blood
level
was
1.75
grams
of
alcohol
per
liter
of
blood
,
while
the
legal
limit
for
driving
in
France
is
0.5
grams
the
level
after
about
two
glasses
of
wine
.

The
0.5-gram
limit
is
equivalent
to
a
blood
alcohol
content
of
.06
percent
,
making
the
French
law
slightly
stricter
than
those
of
most
U.S.
states
,
which
set
the
limit
at
.08
or
.10
percent
blood
alcohol
content
.

In
addition
to
holding
the
photographers
,
Paris
police
searched
the
offices
of
the
major
photo
agencies
on
Sunday
.

Film
seized
from
their
cameras
on
the
spot
also
has
been
developed
by
police
.

``
At
the
expiration
of
the
deadline
for
holding
for
questioning
,
it
is
planned
to
request
the
opening
of
a
judicial
investigation
,
''
the
prosecutor
's
office
said
in
a
statement
Monday
.

Under
French
law
,
opening
an
investigation
is
one
step
toward
charging
someone
with
an
offense
;
a
person
who
is
the
target
of
such
an
investigation
is
presumed
to
be
a
suspect
.

The
possible
offenses
include
involuntary
homicide
,
presumably
by
interfering
with
the
path
of
Diana
's
car
,
and
failing
to
help
the
victims
of
an
accident
,
which
is
obligatory
under
French
law
.

Widespread
reports
indicated
three
or
four
of
the
photographers
would
be
released
and
the
others
would
be
charged
with
failing
to
help
the
victims
.

At
least
some
members
of
the
public
continued
to
hold
the
press
responsible
for
the
princess
's
death
:
an
overnight
graffito
scrawled
on
the
wall
of
the
tunnel
where
the
crash
occurred
said
:
``
Paparazzi
assassins
.
''

In
Britain
,
a
bitter
debate
over
intrusive
media
coverage
of
the
royal
family
continued
to
grow
,
and
there
were
calls
for
tough
new
privacy
laws
,
curbs
on
electronic
eavesdropping
and
other
possible
strictures
on
the
prying
press
.

Though
police
again
Monday
declined
to
discuss
their
investigation
into
the
fatal
crash
in
a
highway
tunnel
along
the
Right
Bank
of
the
Seine
River
,
new
details
from
witnesses
emerged
.

Several
described
photographers
swarming
around
the
car
just
after
the
accident
,
taking
pictures
of
the
victims
.

Frederick
Mailliez
,
a
doctor
,
told
France
2
television
he
came
upon
the
accident
almost
immediately
after
it
occurred
.

After
calling
for
an
ambulance
on
his
car
phone
,
he
went
to
the
aid
of
Diana
,
whom
he
did
not
recognize
.

She
was
unconscious
,
he
said
,
but
moving
her
limbs
.

As
he
worked
on
her
,
he
was
surrounded
by
between
10
and
15
photographers
,
their
flashes
popping
.

They
did
not
interfere
with
him
,
but
did
not
offer
to
help
,
either
,
he
said
.

He
said
Diana
's
head
lay
on
her
own
shoulder
in
a
position
in
which
you
can
not
breathe
if
you
are
unconscious
.
''

He
said
he
lifted
her
head
and
used
an
oxygen
mask
to
help
her
breathe
.

American
tourists
Jack
and
Robin
Firestone
told
the
Agence
France-Presse
news
agency
that
they
were
in
a
taxi
heading
the
opposite
direction
as
the
Mercedes
and
saw
the
wrecked
car
in
the
tunnel
almost
immediately
after
the
accident
.

Robin
Firestone
said
about
five
photographers
were
taking
pictures
as
police
tried
to
remove
them
from
the
scene
.

She
told
AFP
she
saw
a
blond
woman
partly
hanging
out
of
a
shattered
side
window
from
the
back
seat
.

Her
head
was
twisted
to
one
side
,
and
the
photographers
were
taking
pictures
from
just
a
few
inches
away
.

Firestone
said
she
and
her
family
were
``
shocked
''
by
the
photographers
'
behavior
.

Le
Monde
newspaper
reported
that
photographers
jostled
passersby
who
were
attempting
to
offer
help
and
told
police
trying
to
move
them
to
let
them
do
their
work
.

Other
photographers
were
reported
to
have
fled
police
.

One
witness
described
an
officer
on
foot
chasing
a
man
with
a
big
bag
over
his
shoulder
;
another
report
said
two
photographers
sped
away
in
a
car
.

Dartevelle
said
a
witness
had
come
to
the
Ritz
Sunday
night
to
ask
about
talking
to
the
police
.

He
told
officials
at
the
Ritz
he
had
been
driving
in
the
tunnel
ahead
of
the
Mercedes
and
had
seen
the
car
surrounded
by
motorcycles
,
including
one
that
was
trying
to
impede
its
path
.

He
also
saw
motorcycles
returning
from
the
other
direction
,
implying
they
had
been
ahead
of
the
Mercedes
,
Dartevelle
said
.

It
was
not
clear
whether
the
man
later
talked
to
the
police
.

Lawyers
for
the
photographers
,
however
,
contended
they
were
being
condemned
before
any
judgment
and
without
any
evidence
.

``
Without
any
decision
of
justice
,
these
photographers
are
being
presented
as
responsible
for
the
accident
,
''
said
Gilbert
Collard
,
lawyer
for
the
Gamma
press
agency
,
whose
photographer
Christian
Martinez
was
one
of
those
detained
.

``
They
are
responsible
for
being
there
,
for
sure
.

But
I
think
that
's
too
simple
.
''

``
You
have
to
establish
a
line
of
cause
and
effect
between
the
fact
that
the
photographers
were
following
the
vehicle
and
the
accident
.

I
find
it
scandalous
that
in
a
judicial
democracy
like
this
we
throw
citizens
in
the
woodshed
who
do
n't
have
a
chance
to
explain
and
defend
themselves
.
''

He
said
he
had
not
yet
met
with
Martinez
,
who
,
because
no
communication
was
allowed
,
was
not
even
aware
he
had
a
lawyer
.

In
France
,
people
held
for
questioning
can
be
detained
for
up
to
48
hours
.

They
are
allowed
to
meet
with
a
lawyer
once
after
the
20th
hour
,
but
there
is
no
requirement
the
lawyer
be
present
when
they
answer
questions
from
the
police
.

As
others
have
,
Collard
pointed
to
the
driver
of
the
car
as
the
principal
responsible
party
.

``
It
was
he
who
caused
the
accident
,
''
he
said
,
even
before
the
disclosure
of
Paul
's
condition
.

Other
photographers
held
in
custody
were
said
to
be
from
the
Sygma
,
Gamma
and
Angeli
agencies
,
plus
at
least
one
freelancer
with
no
ties
to
an
agency
.

The
Ritz
said
Paul
was
a
native
of
Brittany
in
western
France
and
had
worked
for
the
Ritz
since
1986
after
serving
in
the
French
army
and
air
force
.

As
assistant
director
of
security
,
he
was
not
employed
as
a
chauffeur
,
but
a
Ritz
spokesperson
said
Paul
had
received
training
in
close-quarter
driving
at
a
Mercedes
training
center
near
Stuttgart
,
Germany
.

He
also
was
a
private
pilot
and
a
former
parachutist
.

Among
the
vehicles
he
practiced
in
was
the
Mercedes
S-280
,
the
same
kind
of
car
he
was
driving
the
night
of
the
fatal
crash
.

The
Ritz
had
first
indicated
the
car
was
an
S-600
because
several
of
the
hotel
's
leased
Mercedeses
had
been
employed
in
the
decoy
chase
in
an
attempt
to
lure
photographers
off
Diana
's
trail
.

The
car
was
not
specially
armored
,
but
still
was
a
heavy
vehicle
and
capable
of
traveling
at
great
speed
.

Le
Monde
reported
Monday
that
,
as
it
turned
left
to
go
into
the
tunnel
where
the
accident
occurred
,
the
Mercedes
came
up
behind
a
car
traveling
the
legal
speed
limit
of
30
mph
.

If
true
,
the
driver
might
have
been
forced
to
turn
the
car
more
quickly
than
its
high
speed
could
tolerate
.

The
only
survivor
of
the
crash
,
bodyguard
Trevor
Rees-Jones
,
was
hospitalized
with
brain
and
chest
injuries
.

The
hospital
said
he
was
not
in
danger
,
but
still
is
unable
to
be
interviewed
by
police
.

LONDON
Britain
's
raucous
tabloid
newspapers
were
uncharacteristically
quiet
Monday
,
as
reports
that
pursuing
photographers
might
have
contributed
to
Princess
Diana
's
death
led
to
talk
of
tough
new
privacy
laws
,
curbs
on
electronic
eavesdropping
and
other
strictures
on
the
prying
press
.

Usually
blustery
and
bellicose
,
many
tabloids
opted
for
lyrical
,
subdued
language
this
morning
.

The
Sun
dawned
with
``
Good
Night
Sweet
Princess
''
across
its
front
page
.

By
evening
,
the
Standard
was
describing
the
plans
for
``
A
Unique
Funeral
for
a
Unique
Person
.
''

Its
coverage
included
,
however
,
a
tearful
James
Hewitt
,
who
had
kissed
and
told
in
a
book
about
his
affair
with
Diana
,
gushing
about
how
he
``
loved
her
and
missed
her
terribly
.
''

The
Mirror
displayed
a
luminous
Diana
surrounded
by
a
black
border
and
the
headline
:
``
1961-1997
.
''

The
Express
wrote
about
``
The
Saddest
Homecoming
,
''
with
a
color
photo
of
a
somber
honor
guard
hoisting
her
coffin
high
.

Perhaps
more
significant
,
however
,
the
tabloids
had
nothing
to
say
Monday
regarding
the
allegation
that
their
hunger
for
photos
of
Diana
and
boyfriend
Dodi
Fayed
set
the
stage
for
Sunday
's
tragic
accident
.

Paparazzi
photographers
were
chasing
the
car
Diana
and
Fayed
were
riding
in
early
Sunday
when
it
crashed
in
a
Paris
tunnel
,
killing
the
couple
and
the
car
's
driver
.

The
London
tabloids
have
been
among
the
paparazzi
's
best
clients
,
sometimes
paying
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
candid
or
embarrassing
shots
of
celebrities
and
no
one
was
more
of
a
celebrity
than
Diana
.

``
He
has
n't
done
any
interviews
so
far
,
and
as
far
as
I
know
he
's
not
planning
to
,
''
said
a
spokeswoman
for
Stuart
Higgins
,
editor
of
the
Sun
,
Britain
's
largest-selling
tabloid
,
and
arguably
the
most
aggressive
over
the
years
in
pursuing
the
Diana
story
.

``
We
do
n't
think
this
is
the
right
time
to
talk
about
some
of
the
press
issues
you
're
probably
interested
in
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
Piers
Morgan
,
editor
of
the
Daily
Mirror
,
the
Sun
's
major
competitor
in
chronicling
the
lives
of
Diana
and
the
other
British
royals
,
and
the
paper
that
broke
the
story
of
her
relationship
with
Fayed
.

The
circumstances
of
the
accident
gave
fodder
to
critics
who
claim
the
tabloids
routinely
go
too
far
.

The
chairman
of
Britain
's
Press
Complaints
Commission
,
an
exercise
in
press
self-regulation
,
said
he
intends
to
launch
an
urgent
review
of
paparazzi
practices
.

Martin
Bell
,
a
BBC
reporter
who
covered
the
Bosnian
war
and
now
is
a
member
of
Parliament
,
said
he
expects
the
``
tremendous
''
public
outcry
will
generate
interest
in
laws
that
could
restrict
more
extreme
coverage
.

Bell
said
British
lawmakers
could
consider
a
law
similar
to
the
U.S.
Freedom
of
Information
Act
,
to
ensure
press
access
to
certain
public
records
,
and
another
that
he
referred
to
as
a
``
non-harassment
law
for
a
press
that
has
proved
to
be
unable
to
regulate
itself
.
''

For
years
,
critics
of
the
tabloid
press
have
complained
that
the
papers
routinely
invade
the
privacy
of
celebrities
,
politicians
and
other
public
figures
.

There
is
nothing
in
American
daily
journalism
quite
like
the
British
tabloids
.

With
daily
circulation
figures
in
the
millions
,
the
tabloids
portray
themselves
as
unabashedly
working-class
newspapers
,
as
opposed
to
the
``
quality
''
papers
like
the
Times
,
the
Guardian
,
the
Telegraph
and
the
Independent
.

Instead
of
weighty
analysis
,
the
tabloids
offer
a
steady
diet
of
sensation
and
scandal
,
with
as
much
titillation
as
they
can
muster
.

The
Sun
,
for
example
,
is
famous
for
its
scantily
clad
``
Page
Three
Girls
.
''

The
tabloids
aggressively
pursue
politicians
they
suspect
of
having
affairs
,
and
think
nothing
of
staking
out
a
suspected
mistress
's
apartment
or
using
telephoto
lenses
to
peek
through
windows
.

They
unapologetically
trumpet
their
political
views
the
Sun
is
a
Conservative
Party
paper
,
the
Mirror
a
Labor
Party
paper
.

They
compete
against
one
another
fiercely
and
do
not
hesitate
to
pay
for
news
if
they
think
they
have
to
.

For
the
tabloids
,
day
in
and
day
out
,
no
story
is
bigger
than
the
royal
family
.

All
the
tabloids
employ
royal-watching
reporters
,
some
of
whom
have
become
celebrities
in
their
own
right
,
often
with
six-figure
book
deals
,
because
of
their
royal
scoops
.

Among
the
most
prominent
are
James
Whitaker
,
who
writes
for
the
Mirror
,
and
the
Mail
's
Nigel
Dempster
,
who
has
been
at
the
game
so
long
that
he
's
generally
considered
the
dean
of
the
royal
press
corps
.

Diana
was
the
biggest
royal
story
of
all
.

It
was
the
tabloids
that
broke
the
story
of
her
disillusionment
with
her
marriage
,
the
story
of
her
intercepted
phone
conversation
with
a
close
male
friend
,
and
finally
the
story
of
her
new
relationship
.

Diana
often
complained
about
the
coverage
,
recently
saying
that
``
any
sane
person
would
have
left
Britain
long
ago
''
to
escape
it
.

But
the
princess
also
used
the
tabloids
,
calling
some
of
her
veteran
chroniclers
to
convey
messages
to
the
royal
family
and
burnish
her
own
image
.

And
so
it
remained
until
the
end
.

Monday
,
the
Daily
Mail
ballyhooed
the
last
exclusive
interview
with
the
princess
,
a
two-page
spread
by
writer
Richard
Kay
.

``
When
she
rang
me
up
Saturday
evening
,
she
was
as
happy
as
I
have
ever
heard
her
,
''
it
reported
in
inch-high
type
and
breathless
prose
.

Kay
wrote
that
Diana
was
considering
withdrawing
from
public
life
.

``
She
was
going
to
complete
her
obligations
to
her
charities
and
to
the
anti-personnel
land
mines
cause
,
and
then
,
around
November
,
would
completely
withdraw
from
her
formal
public
life
.
''

The
Mirror
's
Whitaker
was
focused
more
on
himself
Monday
.

Under
a
two-inch-tall
headline
that
proclaimed
,
``
I
am
crying
as
I
write
this
.

...
I
can
not
believe
Diana
is
dead
,
''
he
wrote
about
how
important
Diane
was
to
his
life
.

In
the
same
tabloid
,
under
a
headline
that
said
``
I
feel
shame
...
and
anger
and
an
aching
loss
,
''
chief
photographer
Kent
Gavin
gave
his
readers
this
insight
:
``
She
lived
through
the
camera
lens
and
she
died
because
of
it
.
''

LONDON
As
thousands
of
mourners
paid
their
respects
to
Diana
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
here
Monday
,
officials
at
Buckingham
Palace
prepared
for
a
Saturday
funeral
that
will
combine
the
pomp
of
a
royal
service
with
less-formal
touches
designed
to
reflect
the
extraordinary
role
Diana
played
during
her
life
.

Palace
officials
described
the
services
,
which
will
be
held
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
as
``
a
unique
funeral
for
a
unique
person
.
''

The
arrangment
appeared
devised
to
accommodate
Diana
's
complex
social
position
before
her
death
as
the
divorced
wife
of
the
heir
to
the
throne
,
Prince
Charles
,
as
well
as
her
popularity
among
Britons
and
people
throughout
the
world
.

The
services
will
include
an
elaborate
,
hour-long
procession
that
will
move
Diana
's
coffin
from
St.
James
'
Palace
to
Westminster
Abbey
,
the
13th-century
Gothic
church
where
the
main
service
,
involving
some
2,000
mourners
,
will
be
held
.

Later
that
day
,
she
will
be
buried
in
a
private
ceremony
at
her
family
's
home
in
Althorp
,
north
of
London
.

A
White
House
spokesman
said
Monday
that
no
decision
had
yet
been
made
on
who
would
represent
the
United
States
at
Diana
's
funeral
.

President
Clinton
,
who
is
scheduled
to
remain
on
vacation
in
Martha
's
Vineyard
until
Sunday
,
will
not
attend
the
funeral
,
presidential
spokesman
Joe
Lockhart
said
.

Lockhart
said
the
White
House
is
still
holding
consultations
about
who
will
attend
.

Clinton
wrote
to
British
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
to
offer
his
condolences
on
the
death
of
Diana
,
saying
in
a
letter
released
Monday
that
``
all
of
us
have
lost
a
friend
and
a
strong
voice
for
those
less
fortunate
.
''

Meanwhile
,
the
extraordinary
outpouring
of
grief
and
affection
that
began
with
the
first
reports
of
the
automobile
accident
that
also
claimed
the
life
of
her
friend
Dodi
Fayed
and
their
driver
early
Sunday
morning
,
continued
here
Monday
.

Thousands
of
people
lined
up
to
sign
official
books
of
condolences
at
St.
James
'
Palace
,
where
Diana
's
coffin
will
lie
in
private
until
the
funeral
,
with
mourners
waiting
up
to
six
hours
to
make
their
way
into
the
room
in
the
palace
where
the
books
are
on
display
.

Monday
night
,
police
unexpectedly
closed
several
roads
near
Buckingham
and
St.
James
'
palaces
because
of
the
size
of
the
crowds
.

For
the
second
night
in
a
row
,
a
candlelight
vigil
began
just
before
dark
.

Mounds
of
flowers
marked
the
sidewalk
near
one
gate
at
Kensington
Palace
,
where
Diana
resided
,
and
along
the
main
gates
of
the
palace
.

There
were
flowers
as
well
at
Buckingham
Palace
,
at
St.
James
'
Palace
,
at
Harrod
's
department
store
,
which
is
owned
by
Fayed
's
father
,
the
Egyptian-born
business
tycoon
Mohamed
Al
Fayed
.

There
were
even
flowers
outside
the
gym
where
Diana
regularly
worked
out
.

Tears
flowed
freely
among
many
who
came
to
pay
respects
.

Saturday
's
funeral
,
which
will
begin
at
11
a.m.
6
a.m.
EDT
promises
to
be
the
largest
in
London
since
the
death
of
former
Prime
Minister
Winston
Churchill
in
1965
.

Palace
officials
,
working
in
close
consultation
with
Diana
's
family
and
with
government
officials
,
were
scrambling
Monday
to
complete
the
planning
and
released
only
a
few
details
Monday
.

Prince
Charles
,
Diana
's
former
husband
,
remained
with
their
two
sons
,
Prince
William
and
Prince
Harry
,
at
Balmoral
in
Scotland
,
where
Queen
Elizabeth
also
has
been
vacationing
.

They
are
expected
to
attend
a
private
viewing
of
the
coffin
before
the
funeral
,
as
are
members
of
Diana
's
family
.

But
palace
officials
provided
no
information
about
when
the
royal
family
might
return
to
London
.

Although
Diana
's
family
and
the
royal
family
decided
against
having
the
princess
lie
in
state
until
the
funeral
,
mourners
instead
were
given
the
opportunity
to
sign
a
book
of
condolences
at
St.
James
'
Palace
,
the
brick
structure
built
by
Henry
VIII
450
years
ago
.

Diana
's
coffin
is
lying
in
front
of
the
altar
in
the
palace
's
Chapel
Royal
.

The
books
of
condolence
were
officially
opened
to
the
public
at
10
a.m.
Monday
,
and
by
early
afternoon
the
line
of
those
waiting
to
sign
was
more
than
three
hours
in
length
.

Once
inside
,
the
mourners
signed
one
of
four
books
,
expressing
their
sentiments
on
leaves
of
paper
bordered
in
black
.

The
books
will
remain
open
for
signing
around
the
clock
until
midnight
Friday
.

Diana
's
powerful
appeal
was
evident
from
the
comments
of
those
who
were
lined
up
to
sign
the
books
of
condolence
Monday
afternoon
.

``
She
was
one
of
us
,
''
said
Joan
Bennett
.

``
She
was
the
public
's
queen
.
''

Eileen
Whipps
,
who
described
herself
as
``
a
royalist
''
and
said
she
had
come
to
London
in
1981
for
the
wedding
of
Charles
and
Diana
,
said
,
``
Her
personality
and
attitude
toward
the
ordinary
person
is
what
brings
all
of
us
out
today
.
''

``
Diana
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
has
been
very
kind
to
a
lot
of
people
,
''
said
Reginal
Haley
as
he
waited
to
sign
the
book
for
himself
and
his
wife
.

``
She
has
done
a
lot
.

This
has
brought
tears
to
a
lot
of
faces
.

I
'm
grieving

One
couple
waiting
in
line
said
they
had
closed
their
business
for
the
day
.

They
said
they
would
leave
flowers
at
three
places
Monday
and
,
after
penning
their
condolences
,
spend
the
afternoon
with
the
throngs
at
Kensington
Palace
,
where
Diana
resided
.

``
We
just
had
to
do
it
,
''
said
Marc
Binsted
.

``
She
was
the
first
one
who
was
about
to
change
the
mold
of
the
royal
family
...
,
''
added
Alison
Hanlon
.

There
are
three
categories
of
royal
funerals
,
but
none
were
considered
appropriate
for
the
Princess
of
Wales
.

One
is
the
state
funeral
,
normally
staged
only
for
sovereigns
,
although
the
reigning
king
or
queen
,
with
the
approval
of
Parliament
,
can
order
one
for
others
.

Churchill
,
Britain
's
prime
minister
during
World
War
II
,
is
one
who
received
such
treatment
in
1965
.

The
second
category
is
the
``
ceremonial
royal
funeral
''
and
is
reserved
for
members
of
the
royal
family
of
high
military
rank
,
the
heir
to
the
throne
or
the
consort
of
the
sovereign
.

The
third
category
,
the
private
royal
funeral
,
is
for
all
others
in
the
royal
family
,
their
children
or
their
spouses
.

Officials
said
Diana
's
family
and
members
of
the
royal
family
concluded
that
Diana
should
have
``
a
funeral
that
reflected
her
life
,
''
a
palace
spokesman
said
.

``
A
unique
funeral
is
being
devised
.
''

For
example
,
Diana
's
coffin
will
be
borne
to
Westminster
Abbey
on
the
traditional
gun
carriage
used
for
royal
funerals
,
but
the
process
may
include
people
who
represent
the
charities
and
other
causes
she
championed
.

``
It
is
very
much
appropriate
to
the
princess
'
memory
and
in
line
with
what
the
family
thought
appropriate
,
''
a
government
spokesman
said
.

The
guest
list
will
be
limited
to
2,000
people
,
and
officials
said
it
would
differ
from
a
more-traditional
royal
funeral
in
that
it
will
not
be
limited
to
what
was
described
Monday
as
``
the
great
and
the
good
,
''
but
will
include
others
touched
by
Diana
's
life
as
well
.

``
It
will
be
rather
different
than
one
might
imagine
for
a
formal
royal
funeral
,
''
the
government
spokesman
said
.

Still
,
the
2,000
mourners
invited
to
attend
the
Westminster
service
are
likely
to
include
a
glittering
array
of
world
leaders
.

Invitations
will
go
out
later
in
the
week
.

The
funeral
was
scheduled
for
Saturday
to
give
the
public
a
greater
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
events
.

``
The
family
believe
Saturday
was
the
appropriate
day
to
allow
the
public
to
line
the
route
to
Westminster
Abbey
and
to
be
able
to
pay
respects
,
''
a
government
spokesman
said
.

Officials
said
Blair
had
taken
an
active
role
in
the
funeral
consultations
.

``
The
prime
minister
has
been
very
impressed
by
the
sort
of
outpouring
of
public
grief
and
the
way
that
so
many
ordinary
members
of
the
public
have
been
paying
their
respects
at
Buckingham
Palace
and
Kensington
Palace
and
in
other
parts
of
the
country
,
''
one
official
said
.

LONDON
They
were
described
as
brave
and
courageous
,
princes
of
boys
who
showed
a
stiff
upper
lip
just
four
hours
after
being
told
about
their
mother
's
death
.

Prince
William
and
Prince
Harry
,
in
black
ties
and
somber
faces
,
attended
regular
Sunday
church
services
in
Scotland
,
arriving
aside
their
father
in
a
dark
limousine
with
oversized
windows
.

Their
blank
gazes
appeared
Monday
morning
at
every
London
newsstand
precisely
according
to
royal
plan
.

``
The
shell-shocked
boys
were
doing
what
the
Queen
and
Prince
Charles
would
have
explained
to
them
was
their
duty
,
''
wrote
Ingrid
Seward
,
editor
of
Majesty
magazine
.

``
This
routine
of
duty
is
traditionally
what
has
always
helped
the
royal
family
overcome
its
grief
,
in
public
at
least
.
''

It
is
also
what
would
have
infuriated
their
late
mother
.

``
It
was
absolutely
appalling
to
take
those
kids
to
church
,
business
as
usual
,
''
said
Meg
Henderson
,
a
Scottish
novelist
and
foster
mother
.

``
The
vicar
was
amazed
at
how
dry-eyed
and
controlled
they
were
.

It
is
a
terrible
situation
for
children
at
that
age
to
be
dry-eyed
and
controlled
.

As
official
London
obsessed
Monday
on
the
funeral
arrangements
for
Princess
Diana
,
her
life
's
biggest
ambition
the
raising
of
her
two
sons
as
royals
with
a
human
face
was
fast
becoming
her
most
urgent
and
worrisome
legacy
.

William
,
15
,
and
Harry
,
12
,
had
planned
to
fly
to
London
on
Monday
to
greet
their
mother
upon
her
return
from
a
French
holiday
.

They
,
instead
,
were
being
consoled
by
Queen
Elizabeth
II
and
her
husband
,
Prince
Philip
,
at
Balmoral
,
the
royal
Scottish
palace
,
as
their
father
struggled
with
his
new
role
as
single
parent
.

The
fretting
over
the
two
royal
boys
is
straightforward
:
With
their
bigger-than-life
mother
gone
,
are
they
destined
to
grow
up
like
their
father
,
a
stiff
and
emotionally
rigid
man
who
considered
his
own
childhood
cold
and
lonely
?

Are
Charles
and
the
rest
of
the
royal
family
up
to
the
task
of
grooming
a
popular
21st
century
monarch
a
la
the
sensitive
Diana
?

``
There
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
very
drastic
reassessment
of
what
goes
on
behind
the
palace
walls
because
Prince
Charles
,
as
with
all
fathers
in
a
divorce
situation
,
spends
very
little
time
with
his
boys
,
''
royal
chronicler
Christopher
Wilson
told
reporters
.

``
He
is
going
to
have
to
reorder
his
life
.
''

Begin
optional
trim
The
Diana
vs.
Charles
rift
in
royal
child
rearing
goes
back
well
before
the
princess
'
death
.

In
June
1991
,
when
William
was
accidentally
hit
on
the
head
with
a
golf
club
while
at
boarding
school
,
Diana
's
reservations
about
her
husband
's
hands-off
fathering
made
headlines
.

While
William
lay
in
the
hospital
awaiting
surgery
on
his
skull
,
Charles
excused
himself
to
host
a
party
for
visiting
European
officials
.

Biographer
Andrew
Morton
quoted
a
friend
of
the
princess
later
saying
:
``
Had
this
been
an
isolated
incident
it
would
have
been
unbelievable
.

She
was
n't
surprised
.

It
merely
confirmed
everything
she
thought
about
him
.
''

Charles
,
meanwhile
,
confided
to
friends
that
Diana
sometimes
assured
his
absenteeism
by
scheduling
family
events
when
he
was
already
committed
elsewhere
.

Biographer
Jonathan
Dimbleby
said
Charles
held
his
friends
to
a
vow
of
silence
so
as
not
to
provoke
a
``
surge
in
`
tit-for-tat
'
articles
''
that
would
open
the
monarchy
to
ridicule
.

End
optional
trim
Even
if
Charles
succeeds
as
a
more
attentive
father
,
some
fear
the
Windsor
boys
have
lost
so
much
in
their
departed
mother
that
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
can
assure
her
dreams
for
them
are
ever
realized
.

``
The
chances
are
great
that
the
royal-family
machine
gets
hold
of
the
two
boys
and
makes
them
into
Charleses
,
''
said
a
Diana
mourner
near
Kensington
Palace
.

``
There
is
no
one
else
in
that
family
to
give
them
her
human
touch
.
''

In
her
last
interview
before
her
death
,
Diana
said
she
would
have
long
ago
left
Britain
but
for
concern
for
her
sons
.

Overwhelmed
by
her
own
royal
debut
17
years
ago
,
the
princess
was
determined
to
prepare
the
boys
for
upcoming
responsibilities
while
assuring
they
had
a
good
time
like
other
kids
and
also
experienced
the
world
beyond
privilege
.

The
princess
instituted
``
fun
days
''
and
``
work
days
''
for
the
princes
,
dressing
them
in
jeans
and
baseball
caps
for
a
bite
to
eat
at
McDonald
's
,
a
movie
or
a
ride
on
a
roller-coaster
.

On
work
days
,
the
boys
had
to
dress
properly
,
shake
hands
and
``
forget
any
thoughts
of
selfishness
,
''
she
once
explained
.

``
When
they
begin
,
they
will
be
properly
prepared
,
''
Diana
said
.

``
I
am
making
sure
of
this
.

I
do
n't
want
them
suffering
in
the
way
that
I
did
.
''

But
suffering
,
it
seems
,
is
as
enduring
as
the
royalty
itself
.

Tall
with
his
mother
's
good
looks
and
bashful
glance
,
William
soured
on
life
in
the
royal
fish
bowl
even
before
last
weekend
's
accident
,
which
some
attribute
to
the
relentless
media
attention
paid
to
his
mother
.

Royal
sources
let
it
be
known
last
year
that
the
queen
and
Charles
were
deeply
concerned
that
the
young
heir
to
the
throne
was
becoming
hostile
to
his
public
role
.

British
media
reported
that
he
turned
down
opportunities
to
travel
with
his
mother
because
he
hated
being
stalked
by
photographers
.

The
king-to-be
reportedly
dreads
the
thought
of
assuming
the
high-profile
crown
.

While
both
boys
will
obviously
be
devastated
by
the
loss
of
their
mother
,
there
is
less
public
hand-wringing
over
Harry
,
who
is
younger
,
happy-go-lucky
and
shoulders
little
of
the
burden
of
his
brother
's
royal
destiny
.

William
,
by
contrast
,
is
withdrawn
and
was
painfully
aware
of
his
parents
'
unhappy
marriage
and
his
mother
's
every
up
and
down
.

When
sobbing
Diana
used
to
lock
herself
in
the
bathroom
,
William
would
push
tissues
under
the
door
.

It
was
the
budding
royal
heartthrob
who
suggested
his
mother
conduct
a
charity
auction
of
her
evening
gowns
and
he
urged
her
to
look
outside
Britain
for
personal
happiness
if
need
be
.

``
The
most
wonderful
thing
is
that
Prince
William
has
all
of
the
best
attributes
of
Diana
,
and
she
will
live
on
through
Prince
William
,
''
said
businessman
Richard
Branson
,
a
longtime
friend
of
the
princess
,
during
a
television
tribute
to
her
.

``
It
obviously
would
have
been
wonderful
if
she
could
have
given
him
a
few
more
years
,
but
I
think
most
of
his
formative
years
are
already
there
.

Others

Reeling
from
a
recent
spate
of
massacres
,
Algeria
's
government
on
Monday
ordered
the
house
arrest
of
an
Islamic
leader
released
from
prison
just
six
weeks
ago
.

The
Interior
Ministry
announced
it
will
restrict
the
freedom
of
Abassi
Madani
,
founding
president
of
the
banned
Islamic
Salvation
Front
,
on
grounds
he
had
become
involved
in
unacceptable
political
activities
.

The
decision
came
just
two
days
after
Madani
issued
a
public
call
for
a
``
serious
dialogue
''
with
the
authorities
and
offered
to
launch
an
appeal
to
his
followers
to
bring
``
an
immediate
end
to
the
Algerian
blood
bath
.
''

The
ministry
,
in
a
statement
carried
by
the
Algerian
Press
Service
,
said
:
``
It
is
now
forbidden
for
Abassi
Madani
to
leave
his
house
where
he
now
lives
;
his
guests
are
limited
to
members
of
his
family
.

...
Any
new
violation
''
could
lead
to
Madani
's
reimprisonment
,
the
statement
warned
.

Madani
's
release
from
prison
July
15
had
been
seen
as
a
major
conciliatory
gesture
by
the
regime
toward
its
Islamic
foes
.

But
by
putting
him
back
under
house
arrest
,
the
government
seems
to
be
shifting
back
to
a
harder
line
in
response
to
a
shocking
upsurge
in
violence
in
recent
weeks
,
including
the
killing
of
350
people
by
Islamic
militants
since
last
Thursday
.

The
killing
Thursday
of
up
to
300
civilians
in
Sidi
Rais
,
south
of
Algiers
,
was
the
worst
single
atrocity
of
the
5-year
insurgency
by
Islamic
extremists
against
the
military-backed
regime
of
President
Zeroual
Liamine
.

The
killers
left
severed
heads
on
doorsteps
as
a
grisly
memento
of
their
deeds
.

But
lesser
massacres
have
been
an
almost
daily
occurrence
since
Madani
's
release
.

Increasingly
,
the
nation
's
newspapers
and
opposition
political
parties
are
demanding
an
explanation
from
the
government
why
it
has
been
so
ineffectual
in
stopping
the
violence
.

``
If
means
are
available
to
protect
the
countryside
they
should
be
implemented
,
''
the
French-language
Algiers
newspaper
Liberte
editorialized
on
Saturday
.

``
If
not
,
then
the
truth
should
be
told
.
''

Fighting
between
government
forces
and
Islamic
militias
began
after
authorities
intervened
to
halt
the
second
round
of
parliamentary
elections
in
January
1992
that
Madani
's
Islamic
Salvation
Front
,
known
by
the
initials
FIS
,
was
poised
to
win
.

As
recently
as
June
,
government
officials
insisted
they
had
turned
the
corner
in
the
battle
against
the
militants
and
faced
only
``
remnants
''
of
terrorism
.

But
since
the
parliamentary
elections
in
June
,
which
the
government
claimed
as
a
major
political
victory
,
and
Madani
's
release
from
prison
in
July
,
the
carnage
has
escalated
.

Some
experts
estimate
an
average
of
more
than
70
deaths
per
day
have
occurred
in
the
last
three
months
.

``
Prime
Minister
Ahmed
Ouyihia
's
insistence
that
terrorism
has
been
defeated
is
so
absurd
as
to
be
surreal
,
''
wrote
Algerian
affairs
specialist
Qusai
Saleh
Darwish
last
week
in
the
Saudi
newspaper
Asharq
al-Awsat
,
in
an
article
translated
by
the
Mideast
Mirror
monitoring
service
.

Why
the
upsurge
in
violence
now
?

``
My
speculation
is
that
this
wave
of
massacres
is
a
kind
of
attempt
of
militant
Islamists
to
show
that
there
will
be
no
solution
to
this
crisis
unless
they
are
taken
into
consideration
,
''
said
Egyptian
political
scientist
Gamal
Soltan
,
a
specialist
on
Algeria
at
the
Al
Ahram
Center
for
Political
and
Strategic
Studies
in
Cairo
.

If
the
trend
continues
,
and
the
government
can
not
provide
protect
the
rural
population
,
Soltan
said
,
he
sees
a
danger
that
more
people
will
be
terrorized
into
tacitly
supporting
the
extremists
.

At
present
,
the
outlook
for
any
kind
of
negotiated
solution
appears
bleak
.

Soltan
pointed
out
how
quickly
the
government
rejected
Madani
's
suggestion
for
discussions
.

From
the
extremists
'
side
,
there
is
also
little
appetite
for
talk
,
he
said
.

``
Violence
has
become
a
kind
of
ideology
in
itself
for
these
people
,
''
said
Soltan
.

``
Negotiation
and
compromise
with
people
who
see
things
from
a
strict
religious
perspective
of
right
and
wrong
is
very
difficult
.

massacres
,
meanwhile
,
have
renewed
sympathy
for
ordinary
Algerians
caught
in
the
middle
,
especially
in
the
Arab
world
,
where
some
newspapers
are
now
urging
a
unified
Arab
effort
to
stop
the
bloodshed
.

``
There
must
be
intervention
to
rescue
innocent
people
from
this
cycle
of
murder
,
''
demanded
the
pan-Arab
newspaper
al-Quds
al-Arabi
on
Monday
.

``
What
is
the
world
waiting
for
after
five
years
of
massacres
?

Must
the
entire
Algerian
people
be
exterminated
?

WASHINGTON
Monday
's
announcement
by
Buckingham
Palace
that
Princess
Diana
's
funeral
will
not
be
held
until
Saturday
has
the
big
American
networks
rethinking
their
London
assignments
for
the
bulk
of
this
week
.

All
three
networks
will
have
live
coverage
of
the
funeral
which
will
begin
at
6
a.m.
Eastern
time
in
the
United
States
,
but
none
of
the
networks
would
say
definitely
who
might
anchor
their
broadcasts
that
morning
.

The
presumption
is
that
the
principal
anchors
from
the
morning
and
evening
news
shows
will
be
back
in
New
York
by
midweek
but
would
return
to
London
at
the
end
of
the
week
for
funeral
coverage
.

The
big
three
network
anchors
ABC
's
Peter
Jennings
,
CBS
's
Dan
Rather
and
NBC
's
Tom
Brokaw
canceled
vacations
to
make
their
network
appearances
Sunday
night
,
then
flew
to
London
to
anchor
their
newscasts
Monday
night
and
were
likely
to
broadcast
from
there
again
Tuesday
night
.

But
after
that
no
network
has
made
a
decision
about
how
long
its
stars
will
remain
overseas
.

Jennings
anchored
a
two-hour
special
Sunday
with
Diane
Sawyer
and
Barbara
Walters
;
Rather
anchored
a
special
edition
of
``
60
Minutes
''
that
evening
.

It
is
``
most
likely
''
that
Brokaw
and
``
Today
''
co-anchor
Katie
Couric
will
return
to
London
for
the
funeral
rites
at
week
's
end
,
an
NBC
spokeswoman
said
Monday
.

NBC
News
announced
Monday
that
in
the
wake
of
the
Princess
Diana
tragedy
,
the
network
has
increased
its
``
Dateline
''
schedule
this
week
.

The
network
,
which
had
originally
scheduled
a
movie
for
Labor
Day
,
restored
``
Dateline
''
to
the
lineup
Monday
night
and
added
a
Wednesday
edition
as
well
to
its
other
regular
weekly
``
Dateline
''
editions
,
also
including
Sunday
which
was
totally
devoted
to
the
death
of
Diana
,
Tuesday
night
and
Friday
.

At
ABC
,
previous
reports
of
``
Nightline
''
anchor
Ted
Koppel
breaking
off
a
European
vacation
to
broadcast
from
London
this
week
have
been
discounted
.

Koppel
is
attending
a
conference
in
Prague
to
which
he
is
committed
and
there
are
no
plans
at
present
to
call
him
to
London
,
network
sources
said
Monday
.

The
network
also
said
that
``
Good
Morning
America
's
''
co-anchor-in-waiting
Lisa
McRee
has
flown
to
London
to
serve
as
a
contributing
correspondent
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
to
help
co-anchor
Charlie
Gibson
in
``
GMA
's
''
coverage
of
the
Princess
Diana
story
.

McRee
is
slated
to
replace
Joan
Lunden
as
co-anchor
on
the
program
starting
next
Monday
.

As
for
Gibson
's
stay
in
London
,
it
probably
wo
n't
be
through
the
funeral
.

A
spokesman
said
Monday
that
while
``
it
's
up
in
the
air
,
''
he
predicted
Gibson
could
return
Thursday
then
he
'd
be
on
hand
for
Joan
's
big
send-off
Friday
.

CBS
News
also
announced
that
``
Morning
''
co-anchor
Mark
McEwan
is
returning
to
New
York
after
Monday
's
broadcast
from
London
while
co-anchor
Jane
Robelot
remains
in
London
and
co-anchor
Jose
Diza-Balart
remains
in
Paris
throughout
the
week
.

Meanwhile
,
NBC
co-anchor
Katie
Couric
remains
in
London
for
``
Today
,
''
joined
by
MSNBC
and
weekend
``
Today
''
anchor
Jodi
Applegate
,
again
``
most
likely
''
through
Tuesday
's
broadcast
,
as
Matt
Lauer
anchors
from
New
York
.

CNN
,
which
with
MSNBC
and
Fox
News
Channel
has
delivered
almost
constant
coverage
of
the
sad
news
out
of
Paris
and
London
since
Saturday
night
,
said
Sunday
it
had

Chris
Burke
has
been
signed
for
a
recurring
role
on
CBS
's
``
Touched
by
an
Angel
,
''
probably
making
his
first
appearance
early
in
the
new
fall
season
.

Burke
,
32
,
broke
ground
in
1989
when
he
starred
in
ABC
's
``
Life
Goes
On
,
''
becoming
the
first
actor
with
Down
's
syndrome
to
have
a
regular
prime-time
series
role
.

Late
last
season
he
appeared
in
an
episode
of
``
Touched
''
as
Taylor
,
a
special
angel
,
who
helped
a
stroke
victim
deal
with
the
aftermath
of
her
crisis
.

In
his

this
fall
he
'll
help
a

cope
with
the
news
that
their

Ellen
DeGeneres
,
star
of
ABC
's
``
Ellen
,
''
has
told
TV
Guide
her
TV
character
will
get
a
girlfriend
this
season
.

But
she
is
n't
as
comfortable
kissing
a
woman
on
the
screen
as
in
real
life
.

DeGeneres
,
who
came
out
of
the
closet
in
real
life
this
spring
and
drew
big
audiences
for
the
network
when
her
character
revealed
she
is
a
lesbian
,
said
,
``
I
'm
more
comfortable
kissing
a
man
on
camera
because
I
've
done
it
more
times
.

This
kissing
a
woman
is
really
the
last
thing
I
want
to
do
.
''

Since
her
announcement
in
the
spring
,
she
has
mugged
for
the
cameras
with
her
actress
girlfriend
,
Anne
Heche
.

DeGeneres
admits
any
lesbian
relationship
she
portrays
on
the
series
will
be
difficult
for
ABC
.

``
This
is
a
delicate
balancing
act
because
we
do
n't
want
to
lose
any
of
our
audience
,
''
she
said
.

Meanwhile
,
down
in
Birmingham
,
Ala.
,
WBMA
,
the
only
ABC
affiliate
in
the
nation
that
refused
to
air
the
episode
of
``
Ellen
''
in
which
the
central
character
,
played
by
DeGeneres
,
announced
she
was
gay
,
says
it
has
changed
its
mind
.

ABC
plans
to
repeat
the
coming-out
episode
Wednesday
night
and
this
time
around
WBMA
,
which
also
refused
to
air
subsequent
episodes
in
which
``
Ellen
''
told
friends
and
relatives
she
was
gay
,
plans
to
air
it
.

Last
spring
's
decision
by
WBMA
had
angered
some
gay
groups
,
which
continued
to
protest
against
the
station
.

As
the
only
Jewish
students
in
the
rural
Pike
County
public
schools
,
the
Herring
children
say
they
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
religion
the
fundamentalist
Christian
variety
.

When
Paul
Herring
,
14
,
was
sent
to
the
school
office
to
be
disciplined
for
disrupting
class
,
he
was
allegedly
ordered
by
the
vice
principal
to
write
an
essay
on
``
Why
Jesus
Loves
Me
.
''

When
David
Herring
,
13
,
failed
to
bow
his
head
during
a
school
assembly
prayer
,
a
teacher
allegedly
reached
over
and
lowered
it
for
him
.

After
Sarah
Herring
,
11
,
heard
a
minister
deliver
a
fire-and-brimstone
sermon
at
her
elementary
school
,
she
said
she
had
nightmares
for
weeks
about
burning
in
hell
.

The
children
's
parents
,
Sue
and
Wayne
Willis
,
said
they
have
complained
frequently
about
the
activities
,
as
well
as
name-calling
and
other
alleged
abuse
by
other
students
,
only
to
be
dismissed
as
troublemakers
and
to
be
told
,
``
This
is
how
we
do
things
in
Alabama
.
''

Recently
,
aided
by
the
state
chapter
of
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
,
they
filed
suit
in
U.S.
District
Court
against
the
school
system
for
violating
their
children
's
religious
freedom
and
persecuting
them
for
being
Jewish
.

The
suit
asks
that
the
religious
practices
and
persecution
be
stopped
at
once
,
but
does
not
ask
for
any
specific
monetary
damages
.

``
Every
day
that
I
send
my
children
to
Pike
County
schools
,
I
wonder
if
I
am
sending
them
into
a
war
zone
,
''
said
Sue
Willis
,
35
.

``
The
moment
one
event
is
over
,
a
worse
one
follows
on
its
heels
...
.

My
children
are
growing
up
believing
that
America
is
a
caste
society
and
they
are
untouchables
except
for
the
purpose
of
getting
beat
up
.
''

Attorneys
with
the
ACLU
contend
that
this
is
not
just
a
story
of
one
family
's
ordeal
,
but
is
representative
of
a
pattern
of
institutional
intolerance
in
Alabama
toward
anyone
who
is
not
Christian
and
a
continued
flouting
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
.

They
say
the
attitude
filters
down
from
Republican
Gov.
Fob
James
Jr.
,
who
has
supported
a
circuit
judge
's
right
to
display
the
Ten
Commandments
and
to
open
his
court
sessions
with
prayer
,
and
a
state
legislature
that
has
passed
school
prayer
statutes
four
times
in
recent
years
.

It
also
indicates
,
they
said
,
a
national
trend
of
religious
practices
creeping
into
public
schools
,
citing
Gideon
Bible
distributions
and
a
turn
toward
``
student-initiated
prayer
''
during
school
assemblies
.

But
John
R.
Key
,
the
Pike
County
school
superintendent
,
said
he
does
not
think
the
Herring
children
have
been
persecuted
,
and
he
believes
school
officials
worked
hard
to
resolve
any
problems
the
family
has
brought
to
their
attention
.

He
is
disturbed
,
he
said
,
about
``
the
sensationalism
ascribed
to
this
by
the
ACLU
,
''
and
the
unflattering
depiction
of
his
students
and
teachers
in
the
local
news
media
.

``
I
'd
say
95
percent
or
more
of
our
children
have
never
come
in
contact
with
a
Jew
or
anything
other
than
Christianity
,
''
said
Key
,
whose
system
has
about
2,600
students
,
three-quarters
of
them
qualifying
as
poor
.

``
Most
have
never
heard
of
a
swastika
.

...
I
ca
n't
comment
on
some
of
the
behavioral
problems
,
but
most
of
what
I
'm
getting
from
the
teachers
is
that
it
's
a
two-way
street
.

Sometimes
children
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
say
these
,
bring
these
things
on
themselves
.

The
teachers
try
to
prevent
it
,
but
if
you
have
kids
who
brag
and
talk
,
other
kids
are
going
to
do
things
to
them
.
''

The
Willises
charge
that
teachers
and
principals
are
as
guilty
of
persecution
as
the
students
,
citing
a
long
list
of
incidents
over
the
six
years
since
the
family
moved
from
the
Seattle
area
to
Pike
County
,
about
50
miles
southeast
of
Montgomery
.

Among
other
things
,
their
suit
details
what
have
been
``
essentially
Christian
worship
services
in
the
guise
of
school
assemblies
,
''
including
a
``
Birth
of
Jesus
''
play
at
a
school
assembly
,
a
``
Happy
Birthday
,
Jesus
''
party
in
Paul
's
class
,
and
regular
distributions
of
Bibles
in
the
classrooms
by
representatives
of
Gideon
International
.

On
one
occasion
,
the
suit
charges
,
Paul
's
teacher
ordered
him
to
remove
a
Star
of
David
lapel
pin
he
was
wearing
because
she
said
it
was
a
prohibited
gang
symbol
;
on
another
,
a
teacher
responded
to
Sue
Willis
's
complaints
by
allegedly
replying
,
``
If
parents
will
not
save
souls
,
we
have
to
.
''

The
Willises
said
teachers
and
principals
often
have
done
little
or
nothing
to
prevent
students
from
harassing
the
children
,
particularly
Paul
and
David
,
who
,
like
Sarah
,
are
Sue
Willis
's
children
from
an
earlier
marriage
.

According
to
the
suit
,
the
two
boys
have
been
taunted
as
``
Jewish
jokers
''
and
``
Jew
boys
''
;
swastikas
have
been
drawn
on
their
lockers
,
book
bags
and
jackets
;
and
their
yarmulkes
have
been
ripped
from
their
heads
during
High
Holy
Days
,
as
classmates
played
``
keep
away
''
with
them
.

``
We
are
still
hearing
in
Pike
County
,
`
We
will
excuse
your
children
from
religious
exercises
,
'
''
said
Pamela
Sumners
,
a
volunteer
attorney
with
the
ACLU
who
is
handling
the
case
.

``
Well
,
religious
exercises
should
n't
be
going
on
.

``
I
would
hate
for
folks
to
have
the
impression
we
do
n't
have
any
progressive
,
open-minded
people
in
the
state
of
Alabama
.

That
is
not
true
,
''
she
continued
.

``
But
these
things
,
in
terms
of
the
explicitly
Christian
prayer
at
student
assemblies
and
at
school
events
,
are
very
typical
throughout
the
entire
state
of
Alabama
.
''

The
most
recent
school
prayer
statute
,
passed
by
the
state
legislature
in
1993
,
was
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
earlier
this
year
by
a
federal
district
court
in
Alabama
,
Sumners
said
.

But
,
she
said
,
``
the
governor
has
said
that
he
will
appeal
that
case
all
the
way
to
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
,
not
on
the
basis
of
constitutionality
,
but
on
the
theory
that
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
First
Amendment
.

...
The
statute
allowed
nonproselytizing
,
student-initiated
volunteer
prayer
.

The
problem
that
occurs
is
,
you
have
school
officials
selecting
students
to
deliver
these
prayers
,
and
they
are
always
explicitly
Christian
.
''

Most
end
with
the
words
,
she
said
,
``
In
Jesus
's
name
we
pray
.
''

After
the
Pike
County
suit
was
filed
,
Gov.
James
released
a
statement
denouncing
religious
discrimination
and
``
any
attempts
by
school
officials
to
force
students
to
participate
in
religious
activities
against
their
will
,
''
press
secretary
Alfred
Sawyer
said
.

As
for
James
'
support
of
the
school
prayer
statute
,
Sawyer
said
,
``
The
governor
is
not
for
mandated
prayer
in
the
schools
.

He
does
believe
if
students
want
to
pray
,
they
can
.

...
He
believes
the
students
in
Pike
County
should
be
free
to
exhibit
their
faith
.
''

Robert
Boston
,
of
Americans
United
for
Separation
of
Church
and
State
,
said
that
across
the
nation
,
school
prayer
proponents
have
``
developed
new
strategies
for
chipping
away
at
the
wall
between
church
and
state
by
introducing
``
student-initiated
'
prayer
into
assemblies
,
asking
Gideons
to
come
onto
campus
,
inviting
youth
ministers
.
''

Some
courts
have
upheld
the
practices
;
others
have
not
.

In
Duval
County
,
Fla.
,
a
1992
school
board
policy
encouraging
voluntary
student
``
messages
''
was
challenged
by
students
and
parents
;
in
May
,
the
11th
Circuit
Court
dismissed
the
suit
,
in
effect
upholding
the
policy
.

In
Upshur
County
,
W.Va.
,
a
federal
district
court
held
in
1996
that
a
public
school
board
could
constitutionally
allow
the
distribution
of
Bibles
in
secondary
and
elementary
schools
.

In
another
case
,
a
Jewish
high
school
student
in
Utah
sued
to
stop
her
school
choir
director
from
choosing
religious
songs
and
arranging
performances
at
churches
.

A
district
judge
dismissed
the
claims
,
and
Americans
United
has
appealed
to
the
10th
Circuit
Court
.

As
the
school
year
opens
in
Pike
County
,
the
Willises
said
they
are
fearful
for
their
children
,
now
joined
by
the
youngest
,
Rachel
Willis
,
in
kindergarten
,
every
time
they
board
the
school
bus
.

They
are
afraid
the
children
's
spirits
have
been
crushed
by
their
experiences
,
and
they
note
with
sadness
that
David
,
who
used
to
say
he
wanted
to
become
a
rabbi
someday
,
no
longer
speaks
of
the
subject
.

Sue
Willis
said
teachers
have
turned
their
backs
to
her
as
she
tried
to
complain
about
the
practices
and
the
alleged
abuse
.

And
although
Key
wrote
the
family
a
letter
as
a
follow-up
to
their
complaint
about
the
``
Why
Jesus
Loves
Me
''
essay
,
saying
he
wanted
to
ensure
this
would
not
be
repeated
,
he
made
mention
of
the
vice
principal
's
``
well-intentioned
direction
''
and
suggested
the
topic
was
historically
based
``
upon
Paul
's
understanding
that
Jesus
was
a
Great
Prophet
and
Teacher
.
''

That
did
little
to
satisfy
the
Willises
.

``
The
way
I
see
it
,
''
said
Wayne
Willis
,
36
,
who
drives
a
logging
truck
,
``
this
is
the
United
States
of
America
first
and
Alabama
second
.

...
I
think
the
whole
thing
boils
down
to
an
intolerance
for
anything
non-Christian
.

And
it
's
gone
on
long
enough
that
it
's
impossible
to
think
it
's
not
a
conscious
thing
.
''

But
Key
,
who
has
been
superintendent
for
18
years
,
railed
that
``
the
ACLU
is
painting
a
picture
of
us
being
all-white
neo-Nazi
mountain
men
.
''

In
fact
,
he
said
,
the
elementary
school
is
72
percent
black
;
the
high
school
,
65
percent
black
.

The
problems
,
he
said
,
``
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
them
being
Jewish
.

They
have
everything
to
do
with
the
way
the
Herring
boys
are
acting
.
''

On
the
other
hand
,
he
said
,
``
we
would
not
want
any
child
to
feel
like
a
second-class
citizen
.

We
would
not
want
any
child
to
cry
and
shake
and
curl
up
in
a
fetal
position
because
of
something
that
happened
in
school
as
the
suit
alleges
about
Sarah
.
I
'm
not
saying
we
did
everything
,
but
we
did
have
a
very
concerted
effort
to
prevent
that
.
''

LONDON
Two
prideful
patrician
families
agreed
Monday
with
the
British
government
to
give
Princess
Diana
a
``
unique
funeral
''
that
will
combine
the
families
'
wishes
for
privacy
with
public
demands
to
honor
a
woman
who
touched
the
nation
's
heart
.

As
planning
advanced
for
the
11
a.m.
Saturday
ceremonies
that
will
blend
dignity
and
modernity
and
for
which
huge
crowds
are
expected
and
will
be
welcomed
,
the
government
and
palace
made
plain
Britain
mourned
its
dead
princess
in
a
swelling
wave
of
public
grief
.

Central
London
was
convulsed
,
with
all
traffic
around
Buckingham
Palace
closed
because
of
crowds
and
flowers
until
after
the
ceremonies
.

Tens
of
thousands
of
people
,
many
weeping
,
waited
in
hours-long
lines
to
sign
condolence
books
and
to
lay
flowers
honoring
the
royal
with
the
common
touch
.

``
I
just
felt
that
I
had
to
be
here
,
''
said
one
woman
who
took
the
day
off
to
come
to
London
from
the
countryside
.

Landmarks
of
Diana
's
life
and
death
in
central
London
became
touchstones
for
a
spontaneous
circuit
of
grief
as
a
consuming
sadness
replaced
initial
shock
among
people
for
whom
the
slim
,
shy
36-year-old
princess
was
a
radiant
national
icon
.

More
than
50,000
mourners
from
businessmen
in
suits
to
American
tourists
in
shorts
gathered
in
lines
that
were
sometimes
half
a
mile
long
outside
Diana
's
home
at
Kensington
Palace
.

Banks
of
flowers
created
a
moving
tribute
,
an
instant
garden
of
remembrance
.

``
To
the
greatest
queen
Britain
never
had
,
''
read
one
note
.

Buckingham
Palace
logged
1.8
million
visits
to
its
Internet
condolence
page
www.royal.gov.uk
;
60,000
wrote
condolences
in
cyberspace
.

All
day
and
into
the
night
Monday
,
large
crowds
surged
before
the
tall
black
palace
gates
bearing
bouquets
,
sympathy
notes
,
even
a
teddy
bear
.

Notes
of
farewell
,
flowers
seven
feet
deep
and
one
bottle
of
champagne
filled
the
sidewalk
outside
Harrods
,
the
landmark
department
store
in
London
owned
by
the
Egyptian
family
of
Diana
's
companion
Dodi
Fayed
,
who
died
with
the
princess
in
a
Paris
car
crash
early
Sunday
.

``
I
will
never
be
able
to
reconcile
myself
to
the
needless
and
cruel
deaths
of
two
people
who
were
so
vibrant
,
generous
and
full
of
life
.

God
took
their
souls
to
live
together
in
paradise
,
''
said
patriarch
Mohammed
Fayed
on
Monday
.

Dodi
,
his
eldest
son
,
was
buried
after
Sunday
services
at
a
London
mosque
.

The
11,000
light
bulbs
that
make
Harrods
a
nighttime
London
spectacle
will
not
be
switched
on
again
until
after
Diana
's
funeral
.

Amid
calls
for
two
minutes
of
national
silence
,
many
shops
will
be
closed
Saturday
morning
.

Sporting
events
cricket
,
rugby
,
horse
racing
have
been
canceled
and
so
has
the
weekly
Saturday
night
drawing
of
the
National
Lottery
.

On
a
sun-dappled
day
that
tasted
of
approaching
autumn
,
patient
mourners
waited
as
long
as
five
hours
to
sign
condolence
books
at
St.
James
Palace
,
where
Diana
rests
in
a
closed
coffin
before
the
altar
in
the
450-year-old
Chapel
Royal
.

After
its
return
from
France
on
Sunday
,
Diana
's
body
was
ferried
to
the
old
chapel
in
a
gleaming
black
hearse
at
12:10
a.m.
Monday
.

The
chapel
is
next
to
St.
James
'
Palace
,
once
the
residence
of
King
Henry
VIII
,
now
the
London
headquarters
of
Prince
Charles
and
still
the
statutory
seat
of
government
;
ambassadors
to
Britain
are
accredited
to
the
court
of
St.
James
.

As
a
concession
to
her
own
noble
Spencer
family
and
the
royal
Windsor
family
,
which
includes
Diana
's
sons
,
Prince
William
and
Prince
Harry
,
the
princess
will
not
lie
in
state
.

Only
relatives
and
close
friends
will
pass
by
her
bier
,
although
the
books
of
condolence
will
remain
open
round
the
clock
until
the
funeral
and
afterward
if
necessary
.

Divorced
last
year
from
Prince
Charles
,
the
heir
to
the
throne
,
Diana
lost
her
title
``
Her
Royal
Highness
,
''
but
worked
hard
in
good
causes
in
fulfilled
hopes
of
becoming
Britain
's
``
queen
of
hearts
.
''

Thus
,
as
a
beloved
national
and
international
figure
and
mother
of
future
King
William
,
she
will
be
laid
to
rest
with
great
honor
.

It
will
not
be
precisely
a
royal
funeral
,
or
a
state
funeral
.

Just
Diana
's
funeral
;
a
high-profile
,
creative
exercise
in
improvisation
and
farewell
by
a
nation
with
a
great
love
and
a
great
genius
for
ritual
.

``
It
will
be
a
ceremonial
funeral
with
an
escort
of
Horse
Guards
and
the
coffin
will
ride
on
a
gun
carriage
,
''
said
David
Williamson
,
co-editor
of
Debrett
's
Peerage
.

He
said
it
would
more
resemble
the
1979
funeral
for
Lord
Louis
Mountbatten
than
the
1965
state
funeral
of
Winston
Churchill
.

A
spokeswoman
for
Buckingham
Palace
observed
:
``
The
status
is
irrelevant
.

This
is
a
unique
funeral
for
a
unique
person
.
''

A
spokesman
at
10
Downing
Street
said
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
,
the
princess
'
family
and
the
palace
``
all
believe
that
funeral
must
involve
the
public
.

The
prime
minister
thinks
the
outpouring
of
grief
has
been
a
reflection
of
the
depth
of
affection
and
appreciation
that
people
felt
for
Princess
Diana
and
that
the
funeral
should
reflect
that
.
''

Though
President
Clinton
said
Monday
he
would
not
attend
,
a
few
world
leaders
may
be
present
this
weekend
.

The
usual
huge
ambassadorial
presence
,
the
military
overtones
and
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
a
formal
event
of
state
will
be
largely
conspicuous
by
their
absence
.

Charles
Spencer
,
the
princess
'
brother
,
said
``
the
family
has
wholeheartedly
agreed
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
Diana
to
receive
a
public
funeral
.

The
family
acknowledges
that
it
is
right
and
proper
that
the
people
of
Britain
have
their
chance
to
pay
their
respects
.
''

William
and
Harry
,
with
their
father
Prince
Charles
and
their
grandmother
Queen
Elizabeth
,
are
thought
likely
to
remain
in
seclusion
at
Balmoral
Castle
in
Scotland
until
Saturday
's
ceremony
.

Details
were
still
being
worked
out
Monday
.

But
Diana
will
be
borne
in
solemn
public
procession
Saturday
morning
past
the
great
,
visitor-familiar
landmarks
of
British
state
and
royalty
:
along
the
tree-line
Mall
bordering
St.
James
'
Park
,
down
Horse
Guards
Parade
,
along
Whitehall
and
its
ministries
toward
Parliament
Square
.

The
funeral
service
itself
will
be
celebrated
at
historic
Westminster
Abbey
before
2,000
invited
guests
,
including
the
Windsors
,
the
Spencers
,
a
relative
handful
of
foreign
dignitaries
and
many
ordinary
people
whose
lives
Diana
touched
through
her
charitable
work
.

Begin
optional
trim
After
the
funeral
,
in
keeping
with
the
wishes
of
the
Spencers
,
Diana
will
be
buried
in
a
private
ceremony
at
the
family
estate
of
Althorp
about
80
miles
northwest
of
London
.

Twenty
generations
of
Spencer
family
lie
there
.

``
The
body
will
be
laid
to
rest
with
500
years
of
Spencer
ancestors
including
her
father
,
''
Charles
Spencer
said
.

``
This
part
of
the
day
will
be
entirely
private
with
only
immediate
members
of
Diana
attending
the
burial
conducted
by
a
priest
who
is
a
family
friend
.

Respect
for
the
family
's
privacy
at
this
stage
is
thought
to
be
only
just
,
in
view
of
the
public
nature
of
the
early
part
of
the
day
.
''

End
optional
trim
The
grieving
people
of
Britain
seemed
moved
by
international
echoes
of
their
pain
.

By
nightfall
Monday
,
everybody
knew
that
crowds
at
Yankee
Stadium
and
the
U.S.
Open
Tennis
Tournament
had
observed
minutes
of
silence
for
Diana
,
that
there
was
a
carpet
of
flowers
outside
the
British
Embassy
in
Washington
and
that
Pope
John
Paul
II
had
cabled
the
Queen
to
say
he
was
``
deeply
saddened
at
the
news
.
''

There
was
silence
,
too
,
in
Oslo
,
Norway
,
at
the
opening
of
an
international
conference
on
reducing
land
mines
.

Diana
was
the
most
prominent
world
benefactress
of
that
cause
.

LONDON
Monday
was
a
time
for
offering
sympathy
as
well
as
shopping
for
luxuries
at
Harrods
department
store
,
the
crown
jewel
of
the
Fayed
family
empire
.

Consumers
from
around
the
world
flocked
to
London
's
most
famous
department
store
to
pay
respects
to
Dodi
Fayed
,
killed
with
Britain
's
Princess
Diana
and
their
driver
in
a
car
accident
Sunday
in
Paris
.

The
mourners
formed
two
lines
to
sign
condolence
books
and
lay
flowers
at
the
store
owned
by
Fayed
's
billionaire
father
,
Mohammed
.

One
line
began
at
a
display
window
featuring
a
black
Gucci
suit
and
Escada
hand
bag
.

The
other
started
at
the
window
with
the
Richard
Tyler
jacket
and
Jill
Sander
trousers
.

Overhead
,
the
11,000
lights
that
normally
illuminate
the
store
's
ornate
facade
were
turned
off
.

A
British
Union
Jack
flew
at
half
mast
.

``
When
I
worked
in
London
,
this
used
to
be
my
corner
shop
,
''
said
Nubia
Jones
,
who
came
in
from
a
London
suburb
to
purchase
Harrods
'
bread
and
sign
one
of
the
books
.

``
There
really
is
no
other
place
like
this
in
the
world
.

And
to
see
this
...
it
's
all
so
very
sad
.
''

She
had
something
to
say
,
too
,
about
the
high-profile
summer
love
affair
between
42-year-old
Dodi
and
Diana
.

``
Diana
and
Dodi
were
very
much
in
love
.

Were
n't
they
?
''

While
most
of
the
country
and
the
world
remained
riveted
by
Diana
's
death
,
many
here
still
paused
in
their
work
day
to
come
to
Harrods
and
recall
Dodi
,
the
millionaire
film
producer
who
was
buried
Sunday
after
a
25-minute
Muslim
service
at
a
London
mosque
.

They
also
came
to
shop
.

Harrods
lies
in
the
midst
of
the
so-called
``
Tiara
Triangle
''
three
square
miles
carved
out
of
London
's
swanky
neighborhoods
,
Knightsbridge
and
Kensington
.

This
is
where
royals
and
tourists
alike
drool
over
everything
from
fine
diamonds
to
oranges
.

``
It
has
to
be
business
as
normal
,
although
it
will
never
be
quite
normal
ever
again
,
''
a
Harrods
spokesman
said
.

``
We
have
5,000
staff
.

Harrods
is
a
great
British
institution
and
it
has
to
carry
on
,
however
difficult
that
is
given
present
circumstances
.
''

Until
his
summer
romance
with
Diana
,
Dodi
was
a
minor
player
in
newspaper
gossip
columns
.

He
was
often
referred
to
as
a
divorced
playboy
with
a
string
of
gorgeous
ex-girlfriends
.

Dodi
was
born
in
1956
.

His
mother
,
Samira
,
was
the
sister
of
arms
dealer
Adnan
Khashoggi
.

His
parents
divorced
when
he
was
2
.

He
was
educated
at
a
string
of
elite
prep
schools
and
attended
Britain
's
Royal
Military
Academy
at
Sandhurst
in
England
.

For
years
,
he
lived
in
his
father
's
considerable
shadow
.

Egyptian-born
Mohammed
Fayed
is
a
major
player
in
international
business
circles
,
a
former
adviser
to
the
Sultan
of
Brunei
.

He
built
a
financial
stake
in
Middle
East
construction
projects
in
the
1960s
.

Fayed
's
empire
includes
Harrods
and
the
Ritz
Hotel
in
Paris
where
Diana
and
Dodi
had
their
final
meal
Saturday
night
.

Fayed
also
owns
the
once
renowned
,
but
lately
faltering
magazine
called
Punch
and
a
lower-division
English
soccer
team
named
Fulham
.

Despite
his
possessions
,
the
elder
Fayed
craved
being
accepted
by
Britain
's
establishment
,
sponsoring
royal
horse
shows
and
elite
ballets
,
and
often
appearing
by
the
side
of
Queen
Elizabeth
II
and
Diana
.

Yet
as
the
mourners
paused
in
front
of
the
windows
of
Fayed
's
store
,
there
was
little
talk
of
commerce
.

Mostly
,
the
crowd
spoke
of
a
love
affair
that
ended
in
tragedy
.

One
card
left
at
the
entrance
read
:
``
Dodi
,
thank
you
for
giving
Diana
so
much
joy
.

of
mourners
filed
to
a
book
of
condolences
on
a
sidewalk
table
.

``
Heartbreaking
,
''
he
muttered
.

``
Ca
n't
say
much
more
than
that
.

Long
a
symbol
of
entrepreneurial
spirit
that
drove
an
empire
,
Harrods
is
now
a
temple
of
mass
grieving
over
the
deaths
of
a
young
princess
and
the
last
love
of
her
troubled
life
.

The
scene
Monday
at
the
six-story
gingerbread
palace
offered
a
microcosm
of
a
nation
's
people
and
their
raw
emotions
at
a
time
of
sudden
loss
.

Britons
young
and
old
,
rich
and
poor
,
white
and
nonwhite
,
laid
flowers
at
the
store
's
shuttered
Brompton
Road
entrance
.

By
evening
,
the
pile
,
which
also
contained
poems
,
stuffed
animals
and
a
few
lit
candles
,
was
20
feet
across
the
doorway
,
8
feet
out
into
the
sidewalk
and
3
feet
high
.

Over
the
table
of
condolence
books
,
in
a
store
window
displaying
designer
sunglasses
,
was
a
sign
that
said
:
``
Diana
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
1961-1997
.

Emad
``
Dodi
''
Al
Fayed
,
1955-1997
.
''

Some
mourners
wrote
that
Diana
had
touched
their
lives
directly
.

Most
simply
admired
her
beauty
,
grace
and
charitable
work
.

They
expressed
relief
that
,
in
their
view
,
she
had
found
love
with
Dodi
,
the
son
of
Harrods
billionaire
Egyptian
owner
,
a
few
weeks
before
the
two
had
died
early
Sunday
in
a
Paris
car
crash
.

In
pen
and
verbal
outburst
,
a
few
railed
against
the
royal
family
for
slighting
Diana
before
and
after
her
divorce
from
Prince
Charles
,
or
against
the
photographers
who
chased
her
before
her
death
.

``
You
're
animals
,
all
of
you
!
''

shouted
Maureen
Reynolds
,
a
50-year-old
catering
company
manager
,
glaring
at
a
startled
pair
of
photographers
outside
Harrods
.

``
You
never
left
her
alone
and
now
you
've
killed
her
!

I
hope
you
're
satisfied
.
''

Then
she
turned
and
left
,
dabbing
tears
from
her
eyes
.

The
crowd
around
her
remained
silent
.

But
many
admitted
being
on
edge
unable
to
eat
or
sleep
much
in
the
grieving
hours
that
had
blended
into
one
long
day
.

Bloodshot
eyes
and
hollow
expressions
showed
it
.

Diana
's
death
,
they
said
,
evoked
the
emotion
of
a
death
in
the
family
.

Salimata
Sesay
,
a
bingo
parlor
employee
,
awoke
to
the
news
Sunday
and
told
her
boyfriend
she
wanted
to
be
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.

``
Just
think
of
what
she
'd
done
for
people
all
over
Africa
,
in
Bosnia
,
''
said
Sesay
,
30
,
a
native
Londoner
who
grew
up
in
Sierra
Leone
.

``
I
have
n't
eaten
since
I
heard
the
news
and
I
'm
a
bit
shaky
,
''
she
added
.

``
I
've
felt
this
way
just
once
before
,
when
my
dad
died
four
years
ago
.

Lesley
Backhouse
,
32
,
a
civil
servant
,
said
she
thought
immediately
of
a
close
friend
who
had
died
two
years
ago
a
young
woman
who
,
like
Diana
,
had
left
two
children
.

``
I
have
been
trying
to
imagine
what
Diana
's
sons
are
going
through
,
what
she
would
have
wanted
,
and
thinking
how
bad
it
was
for
her
at
the
last
minute
,
when
her
children
were
hundreds
of
miles
away
and
she
could
n't
touch
them
before
she
died
,
''
Backhouse
said
.

Harrods
was
one
landmark
on
a
circuit
of
grief
that
includes
Diana
's
home
at
Kensington
Palace
,
Buckingham
Palance
and
St.
James
Palace
,
where
her
body
rests
.

Tens
of
thousands
of
Britons
made
the
rounds
Monday
on
a
sunny
day
,
many
after
long
travel
from
distant
homes
.

Older
people
in
the
crowd
at
Harrods
remembered
flocking
to
London
for
Diana
's
fairy
tale
wedding
in
1981
.

As
her
marriage
to
Charles
soured
,
many
turned
against
the
monarchy
and
some
mourners
said
Monday
the
``
unique
funeral
''
announced
for
the
princess
fell
short
of
the
full
state
honors
she
deserved
.

``
It
's
time
to
have
a
different
kind
of
monarchy
or
just
let
the
whole
thing
fizzle
out
,
''
said
Sue
Flynn
,
an
accountant
.

``
With
Diana
gone
,
the
royal
family
has
lost
its
mystique
.

It
does
n't
measure
up
.
''

Standing
in
the
condolence
line
was
Caroline
Fearon
,
a
woman
Diana
's
age
who
had
a
life-changing
encounter
with
the
princess
in
a
home
for
battered
women
nearly
three
years
ago
.

Fearon
and
her
four
children
had
just
fled
the
man
who
was
tormenting
her
and
might
have
gone
back
to
him
had
Diana
not
spent
a
half
day
there
speaking
with
her
and
a
few
other
women
undergoing
therapy
.

``
She
came
in
and
sat
down
and
was
just
like
one
of
the
girls
,
''
Fearon
recalled
.

``
She
had
been
through
a
lot
herself
not
violence
but
a
lot
of
abuse
so
she
could
relate
to
us
.

It
was
just
so
comforting
.

That
day
changed
my
life
.
''

Now
living
on
her
own
and
studying
to
become
a
counselor
for
troubled
women
,
Fearon
said
she
was
so
``
devastated
''
by
Diana
's
death
that
she
had
not
slept
since
.

On
the
other
side
of
the
flowers
and
locked
doors
,
Harrods
opened
for
business
Monday
,
with
customers
and

using

Mohammed

who
buried
his

Sunday
night
,
kept
the

wanted

as

For
many
inside

it

``

said
a
sales
clerk
who
left
her
post
in
the
Food
Court
,
passed
through
the
Room
of
Luxury
where
perfume
is
sold
and
stood
at
the
front

,
looking
at
the
pile
of
flowers
from
inside
.

``

WASHINGTON
With
little
guidance
from
an
undemanding
and
largely
tuned-out
electorate
,
Congress
begins
returning
Tuesday
from
its
month-long
summer
recess
to
figure
out
what
to
do
for
an
encore
now
that
it
has
enacted
its
huge
and
generally
popular
budget-balancing
and
tax-cutting
plan
.

If
they
listen
to
their
constituents
,
lawmakers
may
simply
take
care
of
the
necessary
business
and
head
right
back
home
again
,
possibly
in
two
months
or
less
.

Only
a
few
contentious
struggles
,
such
as
campaign
finance
reform
,
could
complicate
a
smooth
slide
toward
adjournment
.

``
As
opposed
to
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
I
was
campaigning
,
I
do
n't
sense
much
passion
out
there
,
''
said
Sen.
Chuck
Hagel
,
R-Neb.
,
after
a
month
of
making
the
rounds
of
coffee
shops
and
other
gathering
spots
in
Nebraska
.

``
There
's
not
one
big
,
dominant
,
passionate
issue
.

...
The
general
feeling
is
keep
doing
what
you
're
doing
,
do
n't
get
distracted
by
political
sideshows
,
and
keep
government
off
my
back
and
out
of
my
life
.
''

In
Sacramento
,
people
talked
a
little
about
the
United
Parcel
Service
strike
and
contaminated
hamburgers
but
had
virtually
nothing
to
say
about
what
Congress
should
be
doing
for
the
rest
of
the
year
,
said
Rep.
Robert
T.
Matsui
,
D-Calif
.

Matsui
had
expected
some
flak
for
voting
against
the
tax
bill
but
got
none
.

No
``
afterglow
''
for
the
budget
deal
either
.

``
People
are
pleased
with
the
economy
and
reasonably
happy
,
''
he
said
.

People
in
New
Hampshire
were
talking
about
everything
from
highways
and
waste
cleanup
to
regulatory
relief
and
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
,
but
``
there
was
no
clear
set
of
priorities
,
''
said
Rep.
John
E.
Sununu
,
R-N.H
.

And
,
in
Michigan
,
``
there
were
n't
any
hurricane
flags
''
being
posted
,
agreed
Rep.
Fred
Upton
,
R-Mich
.

According
to
many
lawmakers
,
Congress
is
under
more
pressure
to
suppress
its
normal
contentiousness
than
it
is
to
embark
on
any
tempestuous
new
crusades
,
despite
both
parties
'
perceived
needs
to
sharpen
their
messages
and
create
a
favorable
climate
for
next
year
's
congressional
campaigns
.

As
a
result
,
congressional
leaders
have
scheduled
few
if
any
bombshell
initiatives
for
the
remainder
of
the
105th
Congress
's
first
session
and
are
pushing
for
adjournment
by
the
end
of
October
,
if
not
before
,
which
would
be
unusually
early
for
a
non-election
year
.

``
We
've
already
had
a
good
year
and
getting
people
home
will
be
a
priority
,
''
said
House
Republican
Conference
Chairman
John
A.
Boehner
,
R-Ohio
.

``
There
's
plenty
of
time
next
year
to
show
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
two
parties
.

One
year
of
that
is
enough
.
''

Congress
has
many
heavyweight
issues
on
its
agenda
,
from
transportation
funding
and
juvenile
crime
to
the
proposed
tobacco
deal
,
hazardous
waste
cleanup
,
overhaul
of
housing
programs
and
new
trade
negotiating
authority
for
President
Clinton
.

The
problem
is
that
many
of
them
are
enormously
complex
or
not
yet
ready
for
action
,
the
tobacco
agreement
being
a
prime
example
of
both
categories
.

Leaders
are
more
interested
in
producing
results
rather
than
long
spectacles
of
congressional
dithering
.

As
a
result
,
many
of
these
big
bills
may
be
put
off
until
next
year
,
according
to
Boehner
and
others
.

Some
lawmakers
may
try
to
force
votes
on
major
reform
initiatives
such
as
revamping
of
campaign
finance
laws
,
but
their
prospects
are
not
helped
by
the
country
's
mellow
mood
and
its
apparent
disinterest
in
the
tales
of
abuse
that
have
been
pouring
out
of
Senate
committee
hearings
on
the
subject
.

When
the
Senate
returns
on
Tuesday
and
the
House
on
Wednesday
,
the
main
order
of
business
will
be
final
action
on
the
13
regular
appropriations
bills
to
fund
the
government
in
the
fiscal
year
that
starts
Oct.
1
.

Those
bills
contain
contested
provisions
about
abortion
,
census
methodology
and
national
educational
testing
.

But
spending
priorities
were
largely
determined
by
the
bipartisan
budget
deal
,
and
Republican
leaders
are
determined
to
avoid
the
kind
of
brinkmanship
that
forced
partial
government
shutdowns
during
budget
fights
two
years
ago
.

Stop-gap
funding
is
planned
for
any
bills
that
are
not
passed
by
the
deadline
,
with
the
goal
of
passing
all
the
bills
by
mid-October
.

The
word
``
shutdown
''
is
not
in
the
congressional
vocabulary
this
year
.

Appropriations
take
on
new
significance
this
year
because
polls
show
the
American
people
are
skeptical
that
Congress
will
carry
out
its
balanced-budget
commitment
,
and
lawmakers
say
many
of
them
see
the
spending
bills
as
a
first
test
.

``
People
at
home
were
still
pressing
me
about
balancing
the
budget
.

They
've
heard
it
before
...
They
want
to
keep
up
the
pressure
to
be
sure
it
happens
,
''
said
Rep.
Robert
W.
Ney
,
R-Ohio
.

House
Speaker
Newt
Gingrich
,
R-Ga.
,
has
set
two
priorities
for
this
fall
,
both
involving
provisions
that
were
dropped
from
the
budget
deal
at
Clinton
's
insistence
and
both
of
which
Republicans
believe
can
be
pursued
to
their
advantage
with
voters
.

One
would
exempt
welfare
recipients
from
various
federal
workplace
standards
as
they
seek
work
;
the
other
would
allow
parents
to
use
tax-free
savings
to
finance
tuition
and
other
costs
for
elementary
and
secondary
education
,
including
private
and
parochial
schools
.

On
the
top
of
his
list
,
Senate
Majority
Leader
Trent
Lott
,
R-Miss.
,
lists
these
two
items
along
with
legislation
to
revamp
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
reauthorize
highway
and
other
transportation
programs
and
a
bill
that
would
impose
sanctions
on
foreign
governments
that
do
not
allow
free
religious
expression
a
top
priority
for
the
Christian
Coalition
.

Other
possibilities
range
from
easing
adoption
procedures
to
creating
a
national
anti-missile
defense
system
,
a
Lott
aide
said
.

Clinton
's
big
new
priority
is
approval
of
legislation
to
allow
``
fast
track
''
congressional
approval
of
trade
agreements
,
meaning
lawmakers
would
have
to
approve
them
as
presented
,
without
amendments
.

Clinton
wants
action
this
year
,
but
Republicans
say
the
pace
could
be
dictated
by
how
far
the
administration
or
Democratic
trade
critics
on
Capitol
Hill
go
in
trying
to
write
labor
and
environmental
protections
into
the
legislation
.

SARAJEVO
,
Bosnia
Hurling
stones
and
swinging
clubs
,
several
hundred
Bosnian
Serbs
attacked
nearly
300
heavily
armed
U.S.
troops
Monday
in
an
attempt
to
take
back
control
of
a
key
television
transmitter
seized
last
week
by
the
Americans
.

The
troops
fended
off
the
assault
with
tear
gas
,
neither
taking
nor
inflicting
casualties
,
but
they
remained
locked
in
a
tense
standoff
with
the
crowd
as
darkness
settled
over
the
remote
hillside
near
the
town
of
Udrigova
in
northeastern
Bosnia
.

Monday
's
melee
the
second
instance
of
apparently
orchestrated
violence
directed
against
U.S
forces
in
five
days
reflects
a
deepening
dilemma
for
the
NATO-led
peacekeeping
force
in
the
Serb-controlled
half
of
Bosnia
.

By
moving
to
wrest
control
of
television
transmitters
and
police
stations
from
Serbs
loyal
to
indicted
war
crimes
suspect
Radovan
Karadzic
,
the
international
force
's
role
has
become
more
perilous
as
it
supports
Bosnian
Serb
President
Biljana
Plavsic
in
her
bitter
fight
with
Karadzic
for
political
control
of
Bosnia
's
Serb
republic
.

Western
nations
have
cast
their
lot
with
Plavsic
,
a
former
close
aide
to
Karadzic
who
has
lately
toned
down
her
wartime
nationalist
rhetoric
and
embraced
key
parts
of
the
U.S.-brokered
peace
agreement
for
Bosnia
.

Washington
and
European
capitals
insist
that
Karadzic
who
stepped
down
as
Bosnian
Serb
leader
last
year
but
has
used
his
considerable
power
to
obstruct
the
peace
process
should
either
be
arrested
to
stand
trial
in
The
Hague
for
genocide
and
crimes
against
humanity
or
quietly
leave
the
country
.

In
recent
days
,
the
result
of
that
policy
tilt
has
been
U.S.
troops
helping
Plavsic
loyalists
to
secure
police
stations
in
disputed
towns
in
the
western
part
of
the
Serb
Republic
,
where
her
support
is
greatest
.

Last
week
,
American
soldiers
knocked
out
a
television
tower
in
Brcko
,
and
on
Thursday
they
blocked
access
to
the
transmission
tower
near
Udrigova
,
northeast
of
Tuzla
.

The
transmission
facilities
were
targeted
by
the
NATO
forces
because
Karadzic
and
his
supporters
in
the
Serb
Republic
's
government
in
Pale
have
used
the
government-run
media
to
whip
up
anti-Western
sentiment
with
heavy-handed
propaganda
,
diplomats
say
.

After
Karadzic
loyalists
attacked
U.S.
troops
and
U.N.
police
monitors
with
rocks
and
molotov
cocktails
last
Thursday
,
Western
officials
warned
that
NATO
would
no
longer
tolerate
what
they
considered
incendiary
broadcasts
against
the
peacekeeping
forces
.

U.S.
troops
blocked
all
access
to
the
transmitter
near
Udrigova
and
disarmed
about
27
Serbs
who
approached
the
tower
with
weapons
.

More
than
100
U.S.
troops
took
up
positions
there
pending
what
NATO
officials
called
an
``
investigation
''
into
which
Serb
faction
should
rightfully
control
the
facility
.

Around
noon
Monday
,
a

of
about
300
Serbs
presumably
Karadzic
partisans
,
officials
said
began
arriving
by
bus
at
the
tower
site
.

Most
of
them
were
men
.

They
appeared
well
organized
and
a
number
of
them
carried
hand-held
radios
,
according
to
NATO
spokesmen
.

The
U.S.
soldiers
,
reinforced
by
more
than
150
additional
troops
,
took
cover
behind
barbed
wire
and
armored
vehicles
as
the
Serbs
began
pelting
them
with
rocks
.

One
reporter
who
visited
the
scene
said
the
Americans
,
while
heavily
armed
,
had
fashioned
clubs
to
defend
themselves
at
close
range
if
necessary
.

U.S.
Apache
helicopter
gunships
hovered
overhead
most
of
the
day
and
after
dark
.

The
Apaches
are
equipped
with
video
cameras
,
and
NATO
spokesmen
said
they
were
probably
taping
the
fracas
below
to
identify
the
Serbs
'
leaders
.

There
was
some
fear
that
the
Serbs
were
armed
with
molotov
cocktails
,
although
none
were
thrown
,
the
spokesmen
said
.

The
spokesmen
said
the
Americans
will
not
be
dislodged
from
the
site
around
the
transmitter
,
which
they
apparently
switched
off
last
Thursday
.

``
Any
attempt
to
take
control
of
the
tower
...
will
be
met
with
whatever
level
of
force
is
necessary
,
''
said
Lt.
Col.
Jim
Cronin
,
spokesman
for
the
NATO-led
peacekeepers
in
Tuzla
.

``
The
people
realize
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
to
make
us
leave
.

Our
forces
are
too
dominant
.
''

For
Karadzic
and
his
allies
,
television
is
a
key
lever
of
control
in
the
Serb
half
of
Bosnia
,
and
with
local
elections
scheduled
for
the
weekend
of
Sept.
13-14
,
its
importance
as
a
propaganda
tool
is
magnified
.

Until
recently
,
Karadzic
's
supporters
maintained
a
virtual
monopoly
on
the
broadcasts
,
feeding
viewers
a
diet
of
Soviet-style
news
laced
with
nationalist
hatred
and
xenophobia
.

Carl
Bildt
,
formerly
the
West
's
top
civilian
official
in
Bosnia
,
once
termed
the
fare
on
Bosnian
Serb
radio
and
television
``
propaganda
that
Stalin
would
be
ashamed
of
.
''

Most
American
workers
like
their
jobs
but
think
their
supervisors
'
management
and
people
skills
are
poor
,
according
to
a
national
survey
by
Bethesda
,
Md.-based
management
consulting
company
Watson
Wyatt
Worldwide
.

About
61
percent
told
the
company
that
they
are
``
satisfied
''
or
``
very
satisfied
''
with
the
work
they
do
,
but
fewer
than
one
in
three
believes
managers
at
the
firms
where
they
work
make
good
and
timely
decisions
.

And
fewer
than
half
of
the
workers
thought
their
supervisors
dealt
fairly
with
them
,
clearly
communicated
goals
,
built
teamwork
or
were
able
to
coach
workers
to
greater
success
.

The
workers
surveyed
also
reported
that
managers
did
not
listen
to
them
.

Only
36
percent
reported
that
their
companies
actively
sought
workers
'
opinions
and
suggestions
,
according
to
the
survey
.

Watson
Wyatt
consultants
said
the
recently
completed
survey
of
9,144
workers
,
at
large
and
small
companies
across
the
country
,
showed
many
employees
remain
disaffected
toward
management
,
even
as
the
pace
of
corporate
downsizing
has
slowed
.

``
No
company
can
lead
the
market
for
long
with
disaffected
workers
,
''
said
John
Parkington
,
a
Watson
Wyatt
consultant
who
specializes
in
organization
effectiveness
.

``
Sure
,
you
can
do
well
enough
especially
in
an
economic
boom
but
a
company
can
only
succeed
over
the
long
haul
if
workers
and
management
alike
are
all
pulling
in
the
same
direction
.
''

One
respondent
,
a
53-year-old
woman
from
Lancaster
,
Calif.
,
who
is
the
circulation
manager
of
a
national
magazine
,
voiced
concerns
echoed
by
the
survey
statistics
.

In
a
telephone
interview
Monday
,
the
15-year
company
veteran
said
she
loves
the
work
she
does
and
her
contacts
with
customers
,
but
that
management
turmoil
was
hurting
company
performance
.

She
said
her
magazine
's
parent
company
recently
had
fired
all
the
top
managers
and
replaced
them
with
new
people
who
tell
them
little
about
the
group
's
future
.

``
I
'm
from
the
old
regime
,
and
the
feeling
is
that
everyone
from
the
old
regime
wo
n't
survive
,
''
she
said
,
asking
that
neither
she
nor
her
employer
be
named
because
she
fears
she
would
lose
her
job
.

``
It
makes
for
uneasy
feelings
.
''

She
said
that
the
competitive
pressures
have
caused
workers
to
turn
against
each
other
.

``
It
affects
their
creative
ability
,
''
she
said
.

``
They
are
all
hesitant
to
share
ideas
with
someone
else
because
they
fear
someone
else
will
get
the
credit
.

There
's
less
creativity
and
less
of
a
sense
of
working
together
for
a
common
goal
.
''

Another
respondent
,
Jeremy
Patchin
,
a
23-year-old
man
who
cleans
cars
at
an
auto
dealership
in
Des
Moines
,
said
managers
at
his
company
are
``
strict
and
arrogant
''
and
seem
unwilling
to
help
workers
advance
at
the
company
.

Patchin
said
he
knew
labor-management
relations
at
the
company
were
rough
even
before
he
was
hired
:
He
said
he
learned
about
the
job
opening
when
a
friend
who
worked
there
was
fired
after
he
became
ill
.

``
When
he
got
fired
,
I
started
calling
in
every
day
for
the
job
until
I
got
hired
,
''
he
said
.

``
I
had
a
baby
on
the
way
and
I
needed
the
benefits
.
''

Despite
their
grievances
,
however
,
most
workers
like
their
jobs
,
the
survey
showed
,
and
want
to
help
their
companies
prosper
.

``
Our
survey
shows
that
workers
want
to
succeed
,
but
sometimes
just
do
n't
know
how
,
''
said
George
Bailey
,
global
director
of
the
Human
Capital
Group
at
Watson
Wyatt
.

About
83
percent
of
the
workers
reported
they
understand
their
company
's
goals
,
87
percent
said
they
understand
their
job
responsibilities
,
and
94
percent
said
they
understand
how
their
job
affects
customers
.

For
example
,
Shirley
Klug
,
the
manager
of
a
convenience
store
in
Ingram
,
Tex.
,
said
she
did
n't
really
mind
working
Monday
while
others
were
out
picnicking
.

``
We
do
n't
have
holidays
,
''
said
Klug
,
47
,
interviewed
as
she
worked
the
cash
register
.

``
We
would
n't
be
a
very
convenient
convenience
store
if
we
took
holidays

PARIS
The
man
driving
the
limousine
in
which
Princess
Diana
was
killed
was
legally
drunk
,
with
more
than
three
times
the
lawful
level
of
alcohol
in
his
blood
as
he
raced
through
central
Paris
at
speeds
of
more
than
110
mph
,
French
sources
said
Monday
.

A
couple
of
American
tourists
,
meanwhile
,
came
forward
to
paint
a
grisly
,
ghoulish
tableau
of
the
scene
of
Diana
's
fatal
injuries
,
with
photographers
crowding
within
inches
of
the
dying
,
moaning
princess
and
other
bloodied
victims
to
snap
their
pictures
and
shoving
aside
police
who
tried
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
.

Authorities
indicated
at
least
some
of
the
seven
photographers
who
had
been
chasing
Diana
on
motorcycles
and
were
detained
after
the
accident
could
be
charged
with
violating
France
's
``
Good
Samaritan
''
law
that
requires
people
to
help
others
in
distress
.

Diana
,
36
,
was
mortally
injured
in
the
high-speed
crash
of
the
black
Mercedes
sedan
early
Sunday
morning
,
while
her
wealthy
companion
,
Dodi
Fayed
,
41
,
and
the
driver
,
a
Ritz
Hotel
employee
named
Henri
Paul
,
were
killed
on
the
spot
.

The
car
hit
a
concrete
pillar
in
an
underground
road
tunnel
running
parallel
to
the
Seine
River
.

Police
detectives
from
the
Paris
Criminal
Brigade
,
heading
the
investigation
into
the
tragedy
,
estimated
Monday
that
the
vehicle
was
traveling
at
least
111
mph
in
a
30-mph
zone
when
it
crashed
.

Confirming
earlier
reports
,
co-workers
at
the
Ritz
said
the
limousine
's
driver
was
not
a
full-time
chauffeur
,
but
a
former
French
serviceman
who
was
deputy
chief
for
security
at
the
exclusive
establishment
owned
by
Fayed
's
father
,
Egyptian
tycoon
Mohammed
Fayed
.

Paul
,
41
,
sometimes
chauffeured
VIP
guests
at
the
hotel
,
they
said
.

Late
Saturday
,
in
a
gambit
to
elude
the
photographers
that
went
tragically
awry
,
the
security
specialist
was
pressed
into
service
to
act
as
driver
for
Diana
and
her
boyfriend
.

Michael
Cole
,
spokesman
for
the
Fayed
family
,
said
in
London
that
Paul
,
``
an
exemplary
employee
''
who
had
picked
up
the
couple
at
the
airport
and
brought
them
into
Paris
earlier
in
the
day
,
had
been
the
third
choice
to
drive
the
couple
from
the
Ritz
after
dinner
.

The
first
driver
and
a
backup
were
surrounded
by
photographers
as
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
hotel
.

In
Paris
,
Bernard
Dartevelle
,
a
lawyer
for
the
elder
Fayed
,
said
the
regular
chauffeur
tried
to
trick
the
photographers
into
following
him
.

Paul
then
left
with
Diana
and
the
younger
Fayed
from
the
rear
of
the
hotel
,
according
to
Cole
,
but
was
detected
by
the
paparazzi
.

One
of
the
photographers
'
motorbikes
,
Cole
claimed
,
tried
to
cut
in
front
of
the
limousine
to
slow
it
down
.

``
The
photographers
were
flashing
off
blitz
lights
into
the
eyes
of
the
people
inside
the
car
,
''
Cole
said
.

``
It
was
like
a
stage
coach
surrounded
by
Indians
,
but
instead
of
firing
arrows
,
they
were
firing
these
lights
into
the
eyes
of
the
people
.
''

Employees
at
the
Ritz
,
where
Paul
,
identified
by
one
hotel
official
as
a
former
commando
in
the
French
air
force
,
had
worked
since
1986
,
openly
expressed
puzzlement
that
he
then
lost
control
of
the
vehicle
.

Far
from
being
an
inexperienced
driver
,
Cole
said
,
Paul
,
a
native
of
the
port
city
of
Lorient
in
Britanny
,
had
taken
two
driving
courses
on
how
to
chauffeur
bulletproof
and
conventional
limousines
at
a
school
run
by
Mercedes
near
Stuttgart
,
Germany
.

Paul
also
had
learned
anti-terrorist
and
anti-hijacking
techniques
.

But
Monday
afternoon
,
French
law
enforcement
sources
dropped
a
bombshell
by
leaking
the
results
of
a
post
mortem
examination
that
found
1.75
grams
the
means
of
measurement
in
France
of
alcohol
per
liter
in
Paul
's
blood
.

The
reported
amounts
of
alcohol
in
Paul
's
blood
would
be
expressed
in
American
terms
as
his
having
a
.175
percent
blood
alcohol
level
.

Terrance
Schiavone
,
president
of
the
National
Commission
Against
Drunk
Driving
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
estimated
that
it
would
take
a
160-pound
man
``
between
eight
and
nine
drinks
in
one
hour
on
an
empty
stomach
''
to
reach
that
level
of
intoxication
.

And
for
every
hour
that
passes
,
a
motorist
loses
the
effect
of
one
drink
.

``
If
he
's
drinking
from
maybe
7
p.m.
to
midnight
and
presumably
he
's
eating
to
maintain
that
level
at
that
late
hour
of
the
crash
,
that
's
just
an
enormous
amount
of
alcohol
,
''
said
Schiavone
.

``
I
think
the
whole
thing
goes
to
show
his
whole
sense
of
judgment
was
impaired
.

According
to
witnesses
interviewed
by
the
Paris
daily
Le
Monde
,
the
Mercedes
280
SE
carrying
Diana
and
her
boyfriend
in
the
back
seat
streaked
at
high
speed
down
a
straightaway
on
the
Seine
's
Right
Bank
,
then
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
by
the
Alma
bridge
spanning
the
river
.

It
was
then
Paul
tried
to
maneuver
to
avoid
running
into
another
vehicle
obeying
the
speed
limit
,
Le
Monde
reported
.

One
witness
,
Gary
Dean
,
38
,
told
another
French
newspaper
,
Le
Parisien
,
that
the
car
was
going
about
90
mph
,
and
``
I
thought
it
would
never
make
it
through
the
tunnel
at
such
a
rate
.
''

Police
investigators
found
skid
marks
just
before
the
first
point
of
impact
,
indicating
Paul
tried
to
brake
.

Accident
experts
,
using
photographs
of
the
wrecked
Mercedes
to
construct
a
computerized
simulation
of
the
accident
,
and
comparing
results
to
pictures
from
crash
tests
,
estimated
the
car
struck
the
post
at
112-121
mph
.

After
the
wreck
,
its
speedometer
was
frozen
at
196
kilometers
an
hour
the
equivalent
of
121
mph
.

One
early
hypothesis
had
been
that
the
pursuing
photographers
might
somehow
have
caused
the
wreck
by
forcing
Paul
to
veer
.

Despite
the
accusations
renewed
by
the
Fayed
family
's
spokesman
on
Monday
,
interviews
with
witnesses
now
lead
Paris
police
to
believe
that
the
photographers
,
mounted
on
motorcycles
and
scooters
,
were
100
yards
distant
when
the
car
crashed
.

But
Dartevelle
,
attorney
for
the
senior
Fayed
,
claimed
that
even
if
Paul
was
drunk
,
it
did
n't
reduce
the
responsibility
of
the
celebrity-chasing
paparazzi
.

``
If
the
photographers
had
not
organized
the
race
in
pursuit
,
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
chauffeur
would
not
have
driven
at
an
excessive
speed
,
''
Dartevelle
said
.

The
tragic
circumstances
of
Diana
's
death
have
lead
to
often
angry
demands
for
restrictions
on
the
activities
of
star-stalking
photographers
and
sudden
and
intense
scrutiny
of
the
publications
they
work
for
.

According
to
Le
Monde
,
witnesses
said
some
photographers
pushed
would-be
rescuers
aside
after
Diana
's
accident
so
they
would
have
a
clear
view
of
the
bleeding
victims
.

Photographers
also
argued
with
the
first
two
police
on
the
scene
to
be
allowed
to
``
do
their
work
,
''
Le
Monde
said

Jack
and
Robin
Firestone
,
a
couple
visiting
Paris
from
New
York
,
were
so
disgusted
by
what
they
saw
in
the
roadway
under
the
Place
de
l'Alma
that
they
contacted
Agence
France-Presse
,
the
French
news
agency
.

``
We
wanted
to
testify
,
because
really
,
the
behavior
of
the
photographers
was
shocking
,
''
AFP
quoted
Robin
Firestone
as
saying
.

``
They
placed
the
lenses
a
few
centimeters
from
the
bodies
and
pushed
away
the
two
policemen
who
were
trying
to
get
them
away
.
''

Not
yet
realizing
who
was
in
the
wreckage
littering
the
incoming
lane
,
Robin
Firestone
told
AFP
``
we
only
saw
the
body
of
a
blond
woman
sticking
out
of
the
smashed
windshield

her

was
turned

But
a
source
close
to
the
investigation
said
Monday
that
one
of
the
photographers
had
used
his
portable
telephone
to
summon
help
.

Dr.
Frederic
Malliez
,
a
physician
who
was
one
of
the
first
helpers
on
the
scene
,
and
who
said
he
tried
to
assist
the
moaning
Diana
by
lifting
up
her
head
and
placing
an
oxygen
mask
on
her
face
,
said
the
``
10
to
15
photographers
''
busily
at
work
did
n't
interfere
with
him
.

The
seven
photographers
detained
for
questioning
were
being
grilled
at
police
headquarters
near
Notre
Dame
cathedral
in
central
Paris
,
and
will
be
kept
in
detention
overnight
Monday

Among
them

Jacques

If
Princess
Diana
leaves
any
gift
to
fashion
,
it
would
be
her
love
for
it
.

She
embraced
the
fashion
industry
in
a
way
that
few
public
figures
outside
of
Hollywood
do
,
and
with
more
passion
than
any
statesman
dares
.

She
did
not
live
long
enough
to
develop
an
iconic
style
,
but
she
had
enough
time
to
discover
and
embrace
the
power
of
clothes
.

She
became
increasingly
daring
with
her
style
,
veering
away
from
traditional
and
conservative
clothes
and
toward
more
form-fitting
and
revealing
ones
.

Fashion
seemed
to
both
fuel
and
benefit
from
her
growing
self-confidence
.

And
by
the
time
she
died
,
she
had
discovered
that
the
jaw-dropping
appeal
of
a
simple
evening
sheath
could
make
the
world
both
look
and
listen
.

``
In
the
last
few
years
,
she
was
so
much
more
confident
in
the
way
she
was
dressing
,
''
says
Vogue
editor
Anna
Wintour
.

``
In
the
early
years
,
she
tended
to
walk
with
a
bit
of
a
slump
,
as
if
she
was
worried
about
her
height
.
''

Over
time
,
her
shy
glances
took
on
a
hint
of
the
seductive
.

Her
commanding
height
was
transformed
from
a
girl
's
burden
into
a
young
woman
's
best
asset
.

And
her
awkward
innocence
blossomed
into
graceful
self-awareness
.

In
the
beginning
,
while
she
was
still
under
the
thumb
of
the
House
of
Windsor
,
she
did
not
look
at
the
pages
of
fashion
magazines
,
the
runways
or
her
contemporaries
for
a
style
sensibility
.

She
relied
on
tradition
and
fairy
tales
.

Her
image
resulted
from
``
the
demands
of
the
job
and
even
,
at
times
,
the
subliminal
needs
of
the
British
public
,
''
wrote
Vogue
European
Editor-at-Large
Hamish
Bowles
.

She
dressed
in
the
manner
that
the
world
demanded
like
the
princess
of
our
imagination
.

Bows
,
ruffles
,
pastels
.

Fantasies
,
though
,
tend
to
be
frozen
in
time
.

They
are
removed
from
the
modern
world
.

Her
look
back
then
was
not
sophisticated
,
elegant
or
sexy
.

It
was
pure
froth
.

``
Her
style
was
extremely
conventional
,
''
says
Anne
Hollander
,
fashion
historian
and
author
of
``
Seeing
Through
Clothes
.
''

``
Her
clothes
at
the
beginning
of
her
time
as
a
princess
were
faintly
ridiculous
.
''

The
silliness
is
apparent
now
,
at
a
time
when
we
are
surrounded
by
sleek
evening
gowns
and
when
even
the
wealthiest
and
most
celebrated
blushing
brides
turn
to
designers
such
as
Vera
Wang
for
understated
grandeur
.

As
Princess
Diana
stepped
further
away
from
the
control
of
the
royal
family
,
she
like
many
young
women
began
the
long
process
of
self-definition
.

And
while
her
essential
sense
of
self
came
from
her
head
and
her
heart
,
she
used
fashion
to
add
details
and
flourishes
.

``
She
loved
fashion
;
she
adored
it
,
''
Wintour
says
.

``
She
was
very
concerned
with
the
way
she
looked
.

...
I
think
because
she
was
photographed
so
much
,
she
was
looking
at
her
picture
and
how
she
looked
.
''

With
her
death
,
the
British
fashion
industry
has
lost
one
of
its
most
recognizable
champions
.

Not
only
did
the
princess
wear
the
work
of
British
designers
,
but
she
took
an
active
role
in
supporting
and
publicizing
fashion
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

During
London
's
fashion
week
,
when
designers
present
their
collections
before
the
world
's
press
,
she
hosted
cocktail
parties
for
visiting
editors
.

She
even
brought
along
Prince
William
to
one
such
event
.

The
princess
dropped
in
on
the
fashion
trade
shows
,
even
attended
the
catwalk
presentations
.

``
For
us
,
many
of
the
things
that
she
did
came
at
a
time
when
London
fashion
week
was
not
doing
as
well
as
it
's
doing
now
,
''
says
John
Wilson
,
chief
executive
of
the
British
Fashion
Council
in
London
.

``
There
was
a
recession
and
designers
were
not
performing
as
well
as
they
're
doing
now
.

...
I
think
her
contribution
is
immeasurable
and
irreplaceable
.
''

Now
,
the
British
fashion
industry
suffers
not
from
lack
of
attention
but
from
too
much
of
it
.

French
design
houses
have
been
poaching
the
brightest
British
stars
to
take
over
moribund
collections
.

John
Galliano
now
designs
for
Christian
Dior
,
Alexander
McQueen
for
Givenchy
,
Stella
McCartney
for
Chloe
.

The
British
community
,
which
must
fight
for
attention
amid
the
high-profile
Italian
and
French
fashion
industries
and
the
American
celebrity
machine
,
has
lost
part
of
its
precious
allure
and
glamour
.

Its
best
representative
on
the
world
stage
is
gone
.

Moreover
,
fashion
as
a
whole
has
lost
one
of
its
most
striking
ambassadors
.

Princess
Diana
did
n't
set
trends
,
but
,
with
increasing
success
,
she
had
incorporated
them
into
her
wardrobe
.

When
she
was
no
longer
Her
Royal
Highness
,
she
did
n't
have
to
limit
herself
mostly
to
garments
created
by
British
designers
.

She
never
deserted
them
,
but
she
branched
out
.

She
wore
clothes
from
Karl
Lagerfeld
's
Chanel
and
Gianni
Versace
.

In
July
,
she
appeared
on
the
cover
of
Vanity
Fair
wearing
a
Versace
dress
.

When
she
began
to
carry
an
urbane
little
handbag
by
Christian
Dior
,
it
soon
was
casually
referred
to
by
her
moniker
and
was
selling
out
of
boutiques
worldwide
.

-0
-
&QC;
Diana
often
wore
dresses
that
left
a
lasting
impression
,
and
winked
at
royal
tradition
.

There
was
a
black
taffeta
dress
that
she
wore
on
her
first
official
evening
engagement
with
Prince
Charles
.

Its
low-cut
neckline
revealed
more
royal
bosom
than
had
ever
been
seen
before
.

Later
,
there
was
the
white
beaded
``
Elvis
''
dress
with
its
standing
collar
that
screamed
Hollywood
.

She
appeared
in
New
York
in
1995
at
a
gala
sponsored
by
the
Council
of
Fashion
Designers
of
America
.

Her
usually
bouffantlike
hair
had
been
slicked
back
into
a
style
that
was
faintly
masculine
,
subtly
sexy
and
certainly
not
what
was
expected
from
a
conservative
royal
.

The
princess
had
discovered
a
glamour
that
worked
for
her
.

It
was
a
turning
point
.

Her
version
of
glamour
had
little
to
do
with
choices
of
clothes
they
were
not
particularly
inspired
or
risk-taking
.

She
was
not
a
Nicole
Kidman
wearing
lavender
Prada
or
chartreuse
Dior
to
the
Oscars
.

She
was
not
like
the
daughters
of
duty-free
mogul
Robert
Miller
who
have
developed
a
reputation
for
buying
and
wearing
edgy
couture
fashion
.

In
many
ways
,
Diana
seemed
to
be
like
a
lot
of
women
around
the
world
who
slowly
through
trial
and
error
figure
out
what
styles
look
good
and
feel
comfortable
.

``
Recently
we
'd
been
seeing
her
in
these
incredibly
slinky
,
sexy
but
not
overly
revealing
evening
dresses
,
''
Wintour
says
.

She
had
a
``
fantastic
figure
and
great
arms
and
she
was
happy
to
show
them
off
.
''

In
the
last
few
years
of
her
life
,
Princess
Diana
followed
fashion
's
lead
and
turned
to
minimalism
to
define
her
style
.

She
threw
off
the
ruffles
and
bows
and
kept
the
beads
and
lace
to
a
minimum
.

She
rid
fussiness
from
her
repertoire
.

Many
will
remember
her
fondness
for
the
evening
sheath
.

Next
spring
,
someone
might
even
say
of
a
simple
formal
gown
with
a
plunging
back
that
it
is
a
Princess
Di
dress
.

But
she
is
not
likely
to
become
a
style
icon
.

She
had
not
yet
made
any
silhouette
completely
her
own
the
way
Grace
Kelly
and
Jacqueline
Kennedy
Onassis
did
.

When
a
woman
ties
a
scarf
around
her
head
and
under
her
neck
in
preparation
for
an
outing
in
a
convertible
,
perhaps
she
immediately
conjures
up
the
image
of
Kelly
.

Onassis
America
's
version
of
a
princess
will
be
always
be
known
for
her
clean-cut
,
slightly
boxy
Oleg
Cassini
suits
and
pink
Halston
pillbox
hat
.

Princess
Diana
still
was
finding
her
way
.

``
She
did
n't
have
a
particular
way
of
dressing
.

She
was
n't
that
strong
of
an
aesthetic
presence
.

Mrs.
Kennedy
had
a
stronger
view
on
how
things
should
look
,
''
Hollander
says
.

``
What
will
be
remembered
is
that
figure
,
by
that
I
mean
the
personage
moving
about
in
those
simple
clothes
.
''

Princess
Diana
was
a
beautiful
,
stylish
young
woman
who
embraced
fashion
but
most
likely
will
be
remembered
for
what
she
did
rather
than
for
what
she
wore
.

And
that
,
in
the
end
,
is
the
more
enduring
legacy
.
